VPleomorphic Adenoma of Soft Palate: Unusual Occurrence of the Major Tumor in Minor Salivary Gland-A Case Report and Literature Review.
p2
aVSalivary gland tumours constitute about less than 4 % of all head and neck tumours. Pleomorphic adenoma, also called benign mixed tumour, is the most common tumour of the salivary glands. About 80-90 % of these tumours occur in the major salivary glands mainly parotid gland and 10 % of them occur in the minor salivary glands. The most common site for pleomorphic adenoma of the minor salivary glands is the palate, followed by the lips and the cheeks. Other rare sites include the floor of the mouth, tongue, tonsil, pharynx, retromolar area and the nasal cavity. Here, we are reporting a case of pleomorphic adenoma of the minor salivary glands of the soft palate in a 36-year-old Indian female. The mass was removed by wide local excision with adequate margins under general anesthesia. There was no recurrence seen after a follow-up period of 1 year.

VPsychiatric aspects of toxoplasmosis: an Indian perspective.
p6
aVToxoplasma gondii is one of the well-studied parasites because of its medical and veterinary importance, and its suitability as a model for cell biology and molecular studies. Latent toxoplasmosis in an immunocompetent host was considered benign until recently. The importance of this parasite has been steadily rising in the field of psychiatry and neurology as it has been implicated in numerous neuropsychiatric disorders. Researchers in India have unfortunately restricted themselves to finding the prevalence of toxoplasma antibodies in special populations and animals. On the other hand, there has been increasing research interest worldwide in T. gondii for its effects on human behaviour, manifestations of which range from psychoses and neuroses to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Toxoplasma infected organisms may be akin to living zombies. From changing the core natural defensive behaviour in mice to changing personality & leading to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans, Toxoplasma brings about subtle but significant & specific changes in its host. Surprisingly there is severe dearth of such studies from India even though prevalence rates of latent Toxoplasma infection are comparable, or in some regions, higher to those found elsewhere in the world. The potential for identifying Toxoplasma induced behavioural alterations is enormous in this part of the world which could have future treatment implications. It's high time that we move beyond researching the obvious and involve ourselves in more rigorous, novel and stimulating studies in the future.

VScope of detectability of circulating antigens of human lymphatic filarial parasite Wuchereria bancrofti with smaller amount of serum by Og4C3 assay: its application in lymphatic filariasis elimination programme.
p10
aVFilarial antigen detection is an appropriate epidemiological indicator for mapping lymphatic filariasis and impact evaluation of filariasis elimination programme in view of low sensitivity of parasite detection. Monoclonal antibody-based Og4C3 immunological test requires 100 µl serum, which is difficult to collect by finger prick method during community based surveys. Hence, we tested lesser volume of serum compared to standard volume of 100 µl to compare its sensitivity and specificity in detecting the circulating filarial antigens. Blood samples were collected from individuals who tested positive [with titer groups 4 (border line positives), 6 (medium positives), and 8 (high positives)] and negative (titre group 3) for Og4C3 assay. Different volumes of serum samples were used to make-up required volume (100 µl) with appropriate dilutions and subjected to Og4C3 assay. The results showed that known negative samples tested negative at all the serum volumes tested. All positives (titer groups 6 and 8) showed positivity at all reduced volumes of serum sample. However one of the medium positive sample showed negative reaction in 5 µl volume of serum and two of the border line positives showed negative at all the serum volume tested. The results thus showed as less as 15 µl serum is adequate for use in Og4C3 assay. So the test can be performed without losing its sensitivity even with 5 µl serum samples at high titre of antigen (titre group 8) and 15 µl for other groups and this method has scope in programme evaluation.

VHigh prevalence and infestation of Mothocya renardi (Isopoda, Cymothoidae) in marine fish Strongylura leiura (Bleeker 1850).
p13
aVCymothoid isopods are parasites that cause severe damage to the fish species. The present study was focused to carry out the parasitic infestation on the one of the important marine fish Strongylura leiura during the 2 years period between June 2009 and May 2011. 272 fish specimens collected and about 157 (57.72 %) fishes were infested by the cymothoid which were concealed under the gill arches of the host. Infested parasite was identified as Mothocya renardi. The prevalence rate of parasites during different seasons of the range of host specificity of isopods was studied. Variation of infestation rate also depends on the size, length and weight of the host. The sites of infestation by the parasitic crustaceans are highly specific. The infestation had affected the normal growth of the host fish and also probably leads the high levels of secondary infections.

aVA total of 311 equine faecal samples (190 horses and 121 mules) collected from six districts of Central Plain Zone, Punjab were examined using standard coprological methods. The results showed an overall prevalence of 27.33 % for strongyles with rare to mild type of infection as evident from egg per gram of faeces. In particular, amongst the examined samples, 17.90 % of horses and 42.14 % of mules were infected and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01). Identification of the faecal culture harvested larval stages, showed 56 % and 46 % of horses and mules, respectively, positive for small strongyles (Cyathostomes). Amongst the large strongyles, highest proportion was recorded for Strongylus vulgaris whereas, S. equinus was found in least proportion. Results indicated that the various risk factors viz. area, season, age and sex of the host had no significant effect on prevalence of strongyle infection in equines.

VPrevalence of Dermanyssus and Ornithonyssus species of mites in poultry farms of Vikarabad area of Hyderabad.
p19
aVThe common blood feeder mites of poultry are from the genera Dermanyssus and Ornithonyssus. Their presence are problematic for the producers either through potential direct effects on weight gain, egg production or sperm production in roosters or as nuisance pests on workers. They also cause anaemia in birds and play a vector role for several human and animal diseases. Five poultry farm buildings of Vikarabad area of Rangareddy district were visited. Samples were collected from a variety of sites, including beneath feed troughs, inside cage fittings and fastening clips, under egg conveyer belts and under manure belts. Heavily mite infested feathers were plucked from three to five individual birds and kept in closed plastic covers. Samples were processed and mounted permanently by using DPX and species differentiation was done. Besides this litter materials and soil samples from the farm were also collected. Massive mixed infestations of Dermanyssus and Ornithonyssus mites were found. The morphological characters provided here can be considered as a practical tool for species differentiation and as these blood feeder mites were most prevalent and important pests of poultry, public health aspects of these parasites should be considered.

VAssessment of risk factors associated with prevalence of coccidiosis in dairy animals of Punjab.
p28
aVA total of 2089 faecal samples (956 buffaloes and 1133 cattle) were collected from 21 districts of five major agro-climatic zones of Punjab during April, 2013-May, 2014. An overall prevalence rate of 32.17 % (672/2089) was recorded for coccidiosis in dairy animals with a significantly higher (P < 0.01) infection rate in buffaloes (35.46 %) in comparison to cattle (29.39 %). Quantitative analysis revealed oocyst per gram of faeces ranging from 200 to 10,000 (1083.72 ± 227.20) and 100 to 2400 (748.72 ± 81.38), in cattle and buffalo populations, respectively. The results of multivariate analysis showed that prevalence of coccidiosis in cattle population was associated with various risk factors viz. districts (P = 0.000; OR 2.749; 95 % CI 1.238-6.107), agro-climatic zones (P = 0.004; OR 2.707; 95 % CI 1.707-4.293) and seasons (P = 0.000; OR 1.106; 95 % CI 0.811-1.509). Similarly, in buffalo population an association with districts (P = 0.000; OR 2.163; 95 % CI 0.702-6.668), agro-climatic zones (P = 0.000; OR 1.237; 95 % CI 0.673-2.277) and seasons (P = 0.100; OR 1.382; 95 % CI 1.003-1.903) was recorded.

aVThe current study was conducted to investigate the incidence of parasitic diseases in bovines which were sick and brought at veterinary hospital for treatment. A total of 366 samples were investigated from cattle (n = 175) and buffaloes (n = 191) presented at Teaching Veterinary Clinical Complex (TVCC), Veterinary College, Junagadh, Gujarat during January to December 2014. Examination of Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smears exhibited that 58.6 % of cattle and 41.2 % of buffaloes were infected with haemoparasites comprising Babesia bigemina, Theileria annulata, and Anaplasma marginale @ of 54.0, 3.4 and 1.1 in cattle and 38.8, 1.2 and 1.2 percent in buffaloes, respectively. The incidence of total haemoparasites and B. bigemina infections was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in cattle whereas, incidence of haemoparasites were recorded significantly higher in the month of July to November (i.e., rainy and autumn) in both cattle and buffaloes, respectively (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001). Coprological examination revealed that the overall incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) parasitic infection was 45.5 % in cattle and 43.4 % in buffaloes. The incidence of individual parasite was 11.4, 1.1, 2.3, 4.5, 1.1, 3.4, 2.3 and 19.3 in cattle and 4.7, 0.9, 0.0, 2.8, 0.9, 5.7, 0.0 and 28.3 % in buffaloes for Eimeria spp., Trichuris spp., Toxocara vitulorum, Strongyle, Fasciola spp., amphistomes, Schistosoma indicum and Buxtonella sulcata, respectively which differ insignificantly (p > 0.05). Seasonal prevalence of GI parasites was highest in summer in both cattle and buffaloes, the data being statistically non-significant (p > 0.05). However, the incidence of B. sulcata in both cattle (19.3 %) and buffaloes (28.3 %) was higher in comparisons to other GI parasites. The present investigation emphasized that B. bigemina and B. sulcata are the most important parasites of bovines of this region.

VStaged Ridge Split Procedure in the Management of Horizontal Ridge Deficiency Utilizing Piezosurgery.
p40
aVEdentulism is an incapacitating and irretrievable condition which can lead unswervingly to functional limitation, physical, psychological and social handicap. Maintenance of bone after tooth loss to improve retention, function, and performance of the restoration is a challenging task. The existence of a thin edentulous ridge signifies a clinical situation that is more complex for the placement of endosseous implants. Dental rehabilitation of the edentulous ridges with oral implants has become a routine treatment modality in the last few decades with consistent long term results.A staged ridge spilt procedure was performed in the maxillary posterior edentulous region employing piezosurgery for the augmentation of horizontal ridge deficiency which was followed by the successful placement of implant supported prosthesis.At the 20 months follow-up, stable results were appreciated with minimal bone loss around the implants.This proficient technique precludes the need for a second surgical site for the procurement of graft which in turn decreases patient discomfort. Hence this procedure can be used as an alternative to other strenuous procedures.

aVMandibular reconstruction has changed significantly over the years and continues to evolve with the introduction of newer technologies and techniques.This article reviews the history of oromandibular reconstruction, biomechanics of mandible, summarizes the reconstruction options available for mandible with defect classification, goals in reconstruction, the various donor sites, current reconstructive options, dental rehabilitation and persistent associated problems.Oromandibular reconstruction, although a challenge for the head and neck reconstructive surgeon, is now reliable and highly successful with excellent long-term functional and aesthetic outcomes with the use of autogenous bone grafts and current reconstructive options. The ideal reconstruction would provide a solid arch to articulate with the upper jaw, restoring swallowing speech, mastication, and esthetics. Autogenous vascularized bone grafts in combination with microsurgical techniques have revolutionized mandibular reconstruction in oral cancer surgery. Current trends in mandibular reconstruction aim to achieve reestablishment of a viable mandible of proper form and maxillary mandibular relationship while decreasing the need for invasive autogenous graft procurement. However the optimal reconstruction of mandibular defects is still controversial in regards to reconstructive options which include the donor site selection, timing of surgery and method of reconstruction.

Although, most children outgrow PMNE with age, the psychological impact on the child warrants parental education and patient motivation and treatment. Motivational therapy, alarm therapy and drug therapy are the mainstay of treatment. Motivational and alarm therapy have better success rates than drug therapy alone. Desmopressin is the commonly used first-line drug and is best for short-term relief. Other drugs such as anti-cholinergics, imipramine and sertraline are used in resistant cases. This review focuses on the assessment and treatment of PMNE.

VFresh water fish, Channa punctatus, as a model for pendimethalin genotoxicity testing: A new approach toward aquatic environmental contaminants.
p58
aVPendimethalin (PND) is one of the common herbicides used worldwide. Fresh water fish, Channa punctatus, was exposed to PND in aquaria wherein its LC50 value was recorded to be 3.6 mg/L. Three sublethal (SL) concentrations, namely, 0.9, 1.8, and 2.7 mg/L were selected for the evaluation of genotoxicity and oxidative stress generated in the fish. In vivo comet assay was carried out in the blood, liver, and gill cells after exposing the fish to aforesaid SL concentrations of PND for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. The results of the comet assay demonstrated the genotoxicity of PND in all the three tissues. Induction of oxidative stress in the gill cells was affirmed by the increased lipid peroxidation (LPO) and decreased levels of reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase. Frequencies of erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA) and micronuclei (MN) were also used to assess the genotoxic potential of PND on C. punctatus. MN frequency did not show any enhancement after PND exposure, but the frequency of ENA such as kidney-shaped nuclei, segmented nuclei and lobed nuclei, showed a significant increase after 24-96 h. Thus, ENA seems to be a better biomarker than MN for PND induced genotoxicity. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 31: 1520-1529, 2016.

aVExtensive use of quinalphos, an organophosphorus pesticide, is likely to reach the aquatic environment and thereby posing a health concern for aquatic organisms. Oxidative stress and antioxidant responses may be good indicators of pesticide contamination in aquatic organisms. The data on quinalphos induced oxidative stress and antioxidant responses in carps are scanty. This study is aimed to assess the two sublethal concentrations of quinalphos (1.09 and 2.18 \u03bcL L(-1) ) on oxidative stress and antioxidant responses of Cyprinus carpio for a period of 20 days. In liver, the malondialdehyde level was found to be significantly increased in both the concentrations. The results of the antioxidant parameters obtained show a significant increase in superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione-S-transferase activity in liver of fish. These results demonstrate that environmentally relevant levels of the insecticide quinalphos can cause oxidative damage and increase the antioxidant scavenging capacity in C. carpio. This may reflect the potential role of these parameters as useful biomarkers for the assessment of pesticide contamination. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 31: 1399-1406, 2016.

aVWithania somnifera Dunal is an Indian medicinal plant with significant pharmacological properties, such as adaptogenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-platelet, anti-hypertensive, hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects. Several chemotypes of W. somnifera include NMITLI-101, NMITLI-118 and NMITLI-128. The present work elaborates the optimization and development of a liposomal delivery system for efficient delivery of NMITLI118RT+ [a standardized ethanolic extract of a new chemotype of W. somnifera Dunal (NMITLI-118) roots] against cerebral stroke in rats. Liposomal systems were prepared using thin-film hydration method and characterized on the basis of size, zeta potential, physical stability, FT-IR, DSC-TGA analysis and surface morphological studies by TEM. NMITLI118RT+ and its formulations (NMITLI118RT+LF) were evaluated for biological activity utilizing middle cerebral artery occlusion model in rats. The Z average of the developed liposomal formulation was about 142.6\u2009±\u20090.09\u2009nm with a zeta potential of -31.20\u2009±\u20091.0\u2009mV. Results of TEM revealed spherical particles in the range of 200\u2009nm. The entrapment efficiency was found to be 94.603\u2009±\u20092%. The formulation was found to be physically stable over a 3-week period. Results were suggestive of the fact that both NMITLI118RT+ and its delivery system possess significant neuroprotective activity in cerebral ischemia. The liposomal system largely exhibits better performance over NMITLI118RT+ precisely in the post-treatment group. The present studies could elucidate the successful development of a delivery system for NMITLI118RT+ and demonstrate their beneficial neuro-protective potential in overcoming and reversing the consequences of I/R injury following stroke.

aVIron oxide nanoparticles (Fe2O3-IONPs) have revolutionized the industry by significant economic and scientific impacts. Enormous increase in the usage of IONPs has raised concerns about their unseen adverse effects. In the current study, we investigated the effects of IONPs and its bulk on oxidative stress biomarkers, histopathology and biodistribution in rats after 28 days repeated oral treatment at 30, 300 and 1000 mg/kg body weight (b.w.). IONPs size in dry, wet forms and crystallinity was determined using TEM, DLS and XRD. The investigation of oxidative stress biomarkers demonstrated significant increase in lipid peroxidation and decrease in reduced glutathione content in the liver, kidney and the brain of the treated groups in a dose dependant manner. Further, antioxidant enzymes catalase, glutathione S transferase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities were significantly elevated along with significant decrease in superoxide dismutase activity in treated rat organs. ICP-OES analysis revealed dose and size dependant accumulation of IONPs in the liver followed by kidney and the brain than bulk. Moreover, accumulation of IONPs at high dose brought pathological changes only in liver. A large fraction of IONPs was eliminated in urine. Bulk material was substantially excreted in faeces than IONPs suggesting increased absorption of IONPs. In conclusion accumulated IONPs and bulk in organs trigger free radical generation, leading to the induction of oxidative stress condition in rats. The results obtained highlight the importance of toxicity assessments in evaluating the efficiency of IONPs for the safe implementation for diversified applications.

We report an intra-operative case of unilateral IJVD in a 32-year-old male, who was operated for cancer of gingivobuccal sulcus. We have reviewed the published literature and have proposed a classification scheme in order to make future reporting systematic. The condition has been classified into type A, B and C based on their morphology. About 75 % of the reported cases are of Type A. Type C is the most complex of all the duplications. Though IJVD is physiologically inconsequential, it has clinical implications. Percutaneous catheterisation of the vein could be hazardous in all cases, but more so in type B and C duplications. As with any anomaly, the risk of accidental injury increases during surgical procedures. It is important to document findings of this anomaly in order to understand its anatomy and implications in a better way.

The in vitro anti-bacterial activity was performed by agar well diffusion method and the results were expressed as the average diameter of zone of inhibition of bacterial growth around the well. The ethanol and methanol extracts showed better anti-bacterial activity with zone of inhibition (20-25 mm) when compared with other tested extracts and standard antibiotic Erythromycin (15 mcg) with zone of inhibition (13-14 mm). Using Fisher's exact test of significance difference was found between two Salmonella strains sensitivity patterns against tested extracts (P \u2a7d 0.035). Extracts of A. indica stem bark also exhibited significant antioxidant activity, thus establishing the extracts as an antioxidant. The results obtained in this study give some scientific support to the A. indica stem bark for further investigation of compounds and in future could be used as drug.

VThe clinico-radiological spectrum of masseteric venous malformation: Case report.
p95
aVDue to its location, intra-masseteric venous malformation often mistaken for a parotid swelling and clinical examination alone frequently underestimates the deep extension of the lesion and rarely gives accurate pre-operative diagnosis. But once it is diagnosed, the feasibility of the treatment and the plan of approach depend on accurate delineation of the extent, size and location of the lesion. Therefore, complimentary radiographic studies are essential for its management. In this case report, typical features of venous malformation within the masseter muscle, including clinical findings (turkey wattle sign) and imaging are presented. Ultrasonography and CT scan were non-contributory in the diagnosis, while on MRI, masseteric venous malformations have a typical appearance that allowed early identification, patient education and its management.

VThe influence of smoking on the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-8 and periodontal parameters in smoker and nonsmoker patients with chronic periodontitis: A clinicobiochemical study.
p98
aVEven though worldwide evidences tend to prove that smoking adversely influences periodontal health, there are few studies demonstrating the effect of levels of salivary matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) in smokers. This study aimed to compare and quantify the levels of MMP-8 in smokers and also to evaluate the effect of smoking on periodontal indices in smokers and nonsmokers with chronic periodontitis.A total number of 60 subjects were selected for the study and were divided into three groups: group I, healthy nonsmoking subjects; group II, nonsmoking patients with chronic periodontitis; group III, smoking patients with chronic periodontitis. Each group consisted of 20 subjects. Saliva sample was collected for the estimation of MMP-8 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method using Quantikine human total MMP-8 immunoassay kit.The levels of the salivary MMP-8 of group III was highest followed by group II and group I, the least. The other periodontal indices, viz. plaque index (PI), probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), were highest for group III, except for gingival index (GI).This study suggests that MMP-8 is involved in periodontal destruction associated with smoking. Additionally, smoking exerts disastrous effects on immune response and can affect the pathogenesis of disease; hence, smoking results in increased severity of periodontal destruction.

VTreatment of cystic lesion of mandible using combination of modified bone granules and calcium phosphate bone cement: A preliminary report.
p102
aVThis study was conducted to evaluate healing of bony cavity in mandible following enucleation of cystic lesion by obliterating the cavity using modified natural bone granules (G Graft) and calcium phosphate bone cement (G Bone).In this technique, after enucleation of cystic lesion, peripheral ostectomy using No. 702 fissure bur and perforation of the inferior cortex using 1.5 mm drill bits were performed. Modified hydroxyapatite granules were used to fill the defect while calcium hydroxide bone cement was used to seal the cavity opening. Thirty-seven patients were treated using this technique. In 30 patients, quality and quantity of bone were within acceptable limits, and in 7 patients, there was extrusion of graft material and post-operative infection.Treatment of cystic lesion of mandible using combination of modified bone granules and calcium phosphate cement is good alternative to other treatment methods. Long-term and comparative studies are required to evaluate its advantage over the other methods of treatment.

VMosquito larvicidal activity of cadmium nanoparticles synthesized from petal extracts of marigold (Tagetes sp.) and rose (Rosa sp.) flower.
p105
aVMosquitoes are blood-thirsty insects and serve as the most important vectors for spreading most notorious diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, and filariasis. The extensive use of synthetic mosquito repellent has resulted in resistance in mosquitoes. Therefore, the development of a reliable, eco-friendly processes for the synthesis of nano dimensional materials is an utmost important aspect of nanotechnology. In the present study, authors report absolute green synthesis of cadmium nanoparticles using marigold and rose flower petal extract. The characterization of nanomaterials was done by using UV-Vis, SEM, FTIR and fluorescent spectrophotometer analysis. Finally cadmium nanoparticles were also evaluated for their larvicidal activity of mosquito. Marigold flower petal extract shows 100 % mortality after 72 h of incubation with 10 ppm of Cd-nanoparticles. No mortality was observed in the control. Therefore, out of two flower petal mediated nanoparticles, only marigold showed better performance towards mosquito larvicidal activity than rose petal extracts. This is the first report on mosquito larvicidal activity of flower-petal mediated cadmium nanoparticles. Thus, the use of marigold petal extract to synthesize cadmium nanoparticles is a rapid, ecofriendly, and a single-step approach and the CdNps formed can be potential mosquito larvicidal agents.

VWeekly iron folic acid supplementation plays differential role in maintaining iron markers level in non-anaemic and anaemic primigravida: A randomized controlled study.
p108
aVAnaemia during pregnancy is most commonly observed and highly prevalent in South-East Asia. Various effective programmes have been laid down for its management, mainly daily supplementation of iron folic acid (IFA) tablets. Following the same, standard obstetrical practice has included the IFA supplementation without requiring the determination of iron deficiency. In this study, a total of 120 primigravida (N = 60; non-anaemic (Hb > 11 g/dl) and N = 60 anaemic (Hb = 8-11 g/dl)) were selected among those attending the Antenatal Clinic in Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, India. They were supplemented with daily and weekly IFA tablets till 6 weeks postpartum. Corresponding changes in haemoglobin level on advance of pregnancy, side effects and compliance associated with daily and weekly IFA supplementation and its associations with iron status markers were studied. The inflammatory markers were also estimated. The statistical significance level (p < 0.05) between the groups were assessed by applying unpaired t-test using SPSS (version 16.0). The obtained results publicized the salutary role of daily IFA supplementation in improving the haemoglobin level and iron status markers in anaemic pregnant women though the levels could not reach up to the non-anaemic haemoglobin levels. However, weekly IFA supplementation seems to be a better approach in non-anaemic pregnant women where almost comparable results were obtained in terms of haematological parameters, gestation length and birth weight.Weekly IFA supplementation found to be as effective as daily supplementation in iron sufficient non-anaemic pregnant women whereas anaemic pregnant women should be prescribed daily IFA supplementation irrespective of iron replete/deplete state.

VWolbachia: The selfish Trojan Horse in dengue control.
p115
aVDengue fever has re-emerged as a major public health challenge. Of late, several promising attempts have been made to control the disease with limited success. An innovative method of biological control of dengue is the use of the bacterium Wolbachia. Selected strains of Wolbachia have been introduced into Aedes aegypti to prevent transmission of dengue viruses by the vector. Wolbachia prevents dengue transmission by either directly blocking the virus or by decreasing the lifespan of the vector. The mechanism by which it causes these effects is not clearly understood. The main concern of this technique is the emergence of a new dengue virus serotype which may evade the protection offered by Wolbachia. The technique is environment friendly and holds promise for control of other vector borne diseases.

VA Study of Brainstem Auditory Evoked Responses in Normal Hearing Patients with Tinnitus.
p118
aVTinnitus is thought to be an auditory phenomenon resulting from spontaneous neuronal activity somewhere along the auditory pathway either in the peripheral or central auditory system. The neural abnormalities underlying tinnitus are largely unknown. This study analysis the auditory brainstem responses in normal hearing patients with tinnitus. This study consisted of 100 patients divided into two groups. Group I (Control): 50 Normal hearing patients without tinnitus. Group II (Study): 50 Normal hearing patients complaining of tinnitus. Both groups were submitted to full audiological history taking, otological examination, basic audiologic evaluation and Auditory brainstem responses (ABR) followed by calculation of the absolute latencies of wave I, III and V and interpeak latencies between waves I-III, III-V and I-V. In the study group 20 patients showed abnormal results in at least 1 of the 6 parameters evaluated. The results of absolute latencies of wave I, III and V showed significant prolongation, but the interpeak latencies of waves I-III, III-V and I-V were not significantly prolonged when compared with control group. Our study data showed that there are changes in the central pathways in the study group. The significance of these changes must be investigated with further audiological and neurological tests. We also understand that ABR has to be included in the work up of tinnitus patients whose hearing is within normal parameters.

aVThe study was conducted to evaluate the audiological and electrophysiological findings in patients with Vitiligo and to compare the findings with otologically and audiologically normal controls. Study group included 50 subjects (25 Males, 25 Females) with Vitiligo (Mean age-27.4 years) and control group contained 40 age-matched normal hearing subjects. Pure tone audiometry (PTA) with extended high frequency audiometry, Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), Tympanometry, Auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and Middle latency responses (MLR) were conducted in all subjects. Comparison of the study group with the control group showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) on PTA, in Transient otoacoustic emissions (TOAEs) at 1, 2, 3, 4 kHz and in distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) at 357, 499, 704, 1003 Hz. On ABR, statistically significant differences were observed between the groups in wave I (p < 0.01) in both ears, wave V (p < 0.05) in left ear and on interpeak latency of I-III (p < 0.01, p < 0.05), III-V (p < 0.01 in left ear) and I-V (p < 0.01, p < 0.05) in left and right ears respectively. When patients with localized vitiligo were compared with generalized vitiligo, the SNR of TOAEs was highly significant in both ears at 2 KHz (p < 0.05), 3 kHz (p < 0.01) and 4 kHz (p < 0.05). PTA average of 2 KHz, 4 and 8 kHz (PTA2) showed a significant difference (p < 0.01) when localized vitiligo was compared to generalized vitiligo. Results support possible auditory and electrophysiological changes in Vitiligo patients along with decreased cochlear function.

p135
aVTo explore the demographics and clinical outcome of patients with thymoma treated with a multimodality approach at our institute.A total of 71 patients with thymoma (Masaoka stage II-IV and WHO subtype AB-B3) treated from 1999-2013 were included in this retrospective analysis. Age, stage, WHO subtypes, details of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were noted. Progression-free survival (PFS) was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and SPSS (version 21.0) was used for statistical analysis.Male:female ratio was 56:15 with median age at presentation of 41 years. Stage-wise distribution was 6:46:19 for stage II, stage III, and stage IV, respectively. A total of 31 patients (44%) had associated myasthenia gravis and 3 had pure red cell aplasia. A total of 57 patients (80%) underwent radical thymectomy and all of these patients received adjuvant radiotherapy. A total of 15 patients and 7 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy, respectively. At median follow-up of 19.3 months (range 7.9-72.3 months), 2-year and 3-year PFS rate for the entire cohort was 78.3% and 57.1%, respectively. On univariate analysis, surgery (hazard ratio [HR] 3.881; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.784-19.220; p = 0.006) and stage (HR 5.457; 95% CI 1.567-18.996; p = 0.0001) were significant prognostic factors and association with myasthenia gravis (HR 0.404; 95% CI 0.151-1.078; p = 0.078) trended towards better PFS. Stage retained its prognostic significance (HR 5.501; 95% CI 2.076-14.573; p = 0.0006) on multivariate analysis.Multimodality management of locally advanced thymoma yields decent survival outcomes. Masaoka stage is an independent prognostic factor for survival and radical surgery should be contemplated in all cases of locoregionally limited thymoma.

VA case series and review of Poncet's disease, and the utility of current diagnostic criteria.
p138
aVPoncet's disease is a well recognized form of reactive arthritis in the presence of extra-articular tuberculosis. There are very limited case reports even from countries where tuberculosis is common and there are no accepted diagnostic criteria for Poncet's disease. In the present study we are describing clinical features of Poncet's disease from a tuberculosis-endemic region along with a proposal of a new diagnostic criteria.All patients diagnosed as having Poncet's disease were included. The clinical details, demographic features, pattern of joint involvement, investigation findings, treatment details and clinical outcomes were recorded on a structured pro forma.Twenty-three patients with Poncet's disease were identified during the study period. Thirteen patients had oligoarthritis and the rest had polyarthritis with ankle joint involvement being most common. The duration of joint symptoms varied from 3 days to 6 years. All patients had non-erosive and non-deforming arthritis. Systemic symptoms were absent in 48% of patients. Mantoux was positive in most cases (81%). Tuberculosis was extrapulmonary in most cases, lymph node tuberculosis being most common. All patients had complete resolution of joint symptoms with anti-tubercular treatment. All the factors contributing to eventual diagnosis of Poncet's disease were carefully analyzed and diagnostic criteria are proposed. In the proposed criteria, there are two essential, two major and three minor criteria. According to these criteria 19 patients had definite and three had probable Poncet's disease.The most common presentation of Poncet's is in the form of oligoarthritis. The proposed criteria can be used for diagnosing Poncet's disease.

p142
aVGas Man software was developed to enhance our understanding of the pharmacokinetics of inhalational anaesthetics. To date the Gas Man software has not been validated in humans. In this study we compared the Gas Man software with real time measured end tidal isoflurane concentrations while using a semi closed circle system in anesthetised patients. Thirty-four ASA I and II patients 18-60 years of age were selected for the study. After a standardized induction anesthesia was maintained with N2O + O2 mixture and isoflurane using the circle system. The fresh gas flow or dial setting of Isoflurane vaporizer were changed at random. The inspired and end-tidal concentration values of isoflurane measured at 1 min intervals were retrieved from the patient monitor. Real time anesthetic settings for the patient were simultaneously simulated in the Gas Man software to generate the inspired and end-tidal concentration of isoflurane values at every minute for comparison. Varvel's criteria have been used to assess this model. The median absolute performance error was 9.39 %, median performance error was -5.30 %, wobble was 5.16 %, and divergence was -1.82 %. All criteria were within limits of the acceptable performance of the model. The end-tidal concentration values of isoflurane in real patients are very close to those predicted by Gas Man software. The pharmocokinetics of inhalational anesthetic administration in patients can be taught accurately using Gas Man technology. This technology may also help in developing different kinetic models of inhalational agents in the body.

VAnti-arthritic activity of a classical Ayurvedic formulation Vatari Guggulu in rats.
p145
aVIn India, Vatari Guggulu has been traditionally used in the Ayurvedic system of medicine to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The current study was undertaken to evaluate anti-arthritic activity of alcoholic extract of Vatari Guggulu in rats. Arthritis was induced by administration of formaldehyde (2%v/v) or Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) into the sub-plantar surface of left hind paw of the animals. The extract was administered to the rats by oral gavages in different doses. Joint swelling was measured in formaldehyde induced arthritis. Various physical, biochemical and histopathological parameters were determined in CFA induced arthritis. Vatari Guggulu extract (VGE) produced significant (P < 0.05) inhibition of joint swelling in both formaldehyde and CFA induced arthritis. The treatment also brought to normalcy the increased white blood cell (WBC) count, rheumatoid factor (RF), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL with an enhancement of haemoglobin (Hb) levels and red blood cell (RBC) count. These effects were found to be dose dependent. These effects were comparable with standard drug indomethacin. Histo-pathological studies of the ankles of VGE treated animals exhibited significant improvements. VGE did not show any toxic symptoms even at a dose of 2000 mg/kg in acute toxicity studies on rats. Thus, Vatari Guggulu, a classical Ayurvedic formulation of the Indian System of Medicine, exhibited significant anti-arthritic activity in formaldehyde and CFA induced arthritis in rats. This study corroborates the claims of Ayurveda on Vatari Guggulu.

aVTo evaluate the in vivo antitumor activity of cleistanthin B in Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma (EAC) and Dalton's ascites lymphoma (DAL) cell lines induced malignant ascites mouse models and DAL cell line induced solid tumor mouse model. All animals were injected with 2 × 10(6) EAC/DAL cells i.p./s.c. to induce malignant ascites and solid tumor and treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 20 mg/kg or cleistanthin B for 10 days. Cleistanthin B was given at three doses viz. 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg. The percentage increase in life span and the overall survival in malignant ascites animals and the tumor volume in solid tumor animals were measured. The haematological parameters were assessed in all animals before and 2 weeks after the treatment. Cleistanthin B 50 mg/kg and 5-FU significantly prolonged the life span (>25%) of malignant ascites tumor bearing animals. The overall survival was significantly improved by both. Only cleistanthin B 50 mg/kg significantly reduced the elevated WBC counts in EAC tumor bearing animals. Both 5-FU and cleistanthin B 50 mg/kg reversed the malignancy induced increase in neutrophils and platelet counts and decrease in lymphocyte counts but not to the normal range. Only 5-FU significantly reduced the solid tumor volume. None of the three doses of cleistanthin B was effective against the solid tumor. Cleistanthin B has antitumor activity against EAC and DAL tumor mice but it is not as effective as 5-FU. At 50 mg/kg dose cleistanthin B exerts significant antitumor activity compared to 25 and 100 mg/kg dose. Its effect on WBC count is higher and advantageous when compared to 5-FU. But cleistanthin B in the doses used is not effective against solid tumor.

VRole of ecolabeling in reducing ecotoxicology.
p151
aVEcolabeling helps consumers to select environment friendly products, while meeting high demands on occupational health, safety, and usability. Ecolabeling undertakes cradle-to-grave approach which helps in minimizing the toxicological impacts at every stage of the product life cycle. The ecolabeling procedure calls for substitution or reduction of hazardous substances thereby reducing the toxicity caused due to these chemicals. China, Japan, Australia, European Union, and Nordic countries are leading in the race of awareness and implementation of ecolabeling schemes. In India, the ecolabeling scheme (Ecomark) was initiated in 1991. The Ecomark scheme lacked adoption of the green marketing principles and thus failed to create an impact. This study presents an overview of ecolabels in European Union, Nordic countries, Germany, China and India. Furthermore, it assesses the awareness of ecolabels among the retailers and traders of environment friendly products in India through a survey. The study highlights that the ecolabels are a success in most of the countries studied and are applied across a range of industrial sectors. The survey is administered to 80 retailers and traders of stores selling environment friendly products across different Indian cities. A correlation is established with the variables identified. The survey results indicate that although the retailers and traders of environment friendly products have low awareness of the ecolabels on environment friendly products, they are taking considerable efforts to promote and deliver environment friendly products to consumers. Large-scale awareness drives initiated by the Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change permeating at grass root levels with the involvement of stakeholders could prove beneficial for promotion of the ecolabeling schemes.

VSocio-ecological studies on marine fishing villages in the selective south coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh.
p155
aVCoasts are an amazing gift of nature. Industrialization, infrastructure development, urbanisation, tourism, mechanized fishing, disposal of industrial and urban wastes and effluents, are all ringing the death-knell of the sensitive coastal ecosystems of recently separated State of Andhra Pradesh. These modern interventions have been violent, disregarding both nature's rejuvenating mechanisms, and the symbiotic relationship that exist between the coast and traditional marine fishing communities. Modern fishing tecnologies using mechanized trawlers and small meshed nets lead directly to overexploitation, which is not sustainable. It is evident that fish have to breed successfully and need to have time to grow if the yield has to be used sustainably. Multiple pressures and excessive technological invasion on these marine fishing villages had created an environment in which life has become physically and mentally unhealthy. The focus of this paper is to emphasize that investing in large-scale industrial fishing, building bigger boats, and giving subsidies for pursuing deep sea fishing would be a waste of resources as the fish hauls in these selelctive districts i.e. Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam and Nellore coastal communities have dropped off alarmingly in recent years. It is essential and crucial to focus research and scientific analysis and establish awareness and education to provide a means of distinguishing responses between improvements in quality of ecosystem and those of damages. The study is to elaborate that long-term ecological gains cannot be sacrificed for short-term economic gains that unfortunately lead to environmental damage. Investigating coastal regulations, policies, and their implementation is an urgent social need for the sake of socio-ecological safety and security of coasts and host communities.

aVChronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm occasionally presenting with features of leukostasis as primary symptoms. Hearing loss is occasionally reported in CML patients. Further whether Imatinib mesylate has any effect on vestibular functions is not known. We conducted a preliminary study to assess hearing pattern in patients with CML on long term TKI therapy. This is a single center, cross sectional study from northern-India. Patients of CML who were on regular Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) therapy for at least 6 months underwent audiovestibular evaluation . A total of 44 CML patients on TKI therapy were assessed over a period of 6 months. The median age of the patients was 41 years, the mean duration of TKI therapy was 36 months. Four patients were found to have otological disorder clinically. On pure tone audiometry of 88 ears normal hearing pattern were found with at low and mid frequencies. There was a down sloping type of curve at higher frequencies in PTA in most of the patients. Cold caloric tests in 42 patients were found as equal response in both ears. We conclude from this preliminary study that there are no audio vestibular dysfunctions amongst patients of CML on TKI. It's a negative study wherein we have ruled out any auditory deficits secondary to Imatinib therapy. Further studies are required to evaluate the audiometric profile in CML patients before Imatinib therapy and to be compared with the patients already on Imatinib in a large cohort.

VMinimally Invasive Neck Dissection (MIND) Using Standard Laparoscopic Equipment: a Preliminary Report and Description of Technique.
p166
aVNeck dissection leaves behind an aesthetically unacceptable scar over front of the neck. Various techniques, both endoscopic and robotic, have been tried to avoid this scar. Though comparatively more cases of robotic surgery are reported than endoscopic neck dissection, the cost and availability of robot precludes many patients from getting the benefit of minimally invasive neck dissection (MIND). We performed minimally invasive neck dissection for two carefully selected patients with early oral cancer and cN0. We used standard endoscopic equipment and ubiquitously available laparoscopic ports. We used gas insufflation to create the working space. Our results show that MIND is feasible and oncologically safe. The scars produced are aesthetically better than that of conventional open neck dissection. This procedure leaves no scars in the anterior aspect of the neck. This technique can be replicated at any center with endoscopic equipments without need for purchasing specialised retractors or a robot.

VSalvage Surgery for Cervical Cancer Recurrences.
p170
aVCervical cancer usually presents in advanced stages and is treated with chemoradiation. About 15-20 % patients present with local recurrence after chemoradiation. Radical surgical resection is the only treatment modality offering long term survival benefit in recurrent cervical cancer. The most common surgical option for these patients is pelvic exenteration. Radical hysterectomy may be done for patients with a small centrally located recurrence in the cervix with no infiltration of adjacent structures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the morbidity and survival outcome following radical hysterectomy and pelvic exenteration for recurrent cancer cervix. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of our patients who underwent surgery for cancer cervix recurrence from January 2010 to December 2014. The postoperative morbidity was considered early if it happened in the initial 30 days of surgery and late if it occurred after 30 days. All patients were followed up till February 2015. Survival analysis was done using Kaplan- Meir method. Between January 2010 and December 2014, 20 patients with recurrent cervical cancer underwent radical surgical resection. The median age of the study group was 43 years (range 28-63 years). Seventeen patients had squamous cell carcinoma and 3 had adenocarcinoma. 13 underwent pelvic exenteration and 7 patients underwent radical type 2 hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphnode dissection. In the exenteration group, 8 patients had anterior exenteration, 4 had total exenteration and one had posterior exenteration. Urinary diversion was done by ileal conduit in 8 patients, double barrel colostomy in two and wet colostomy in two patients. There were no immediate postoperative deaths. Operating time, blood transfusions needed and hospital stay was more in the exenteration group compared to radical hysterectomy patients. After pelvic exenteration post-operative complications were seen in 76.9 % of which the most common was of the urinary tract including 3 patients with pyelonephritis, 5 had renal insufficiency and 2 patients developed urinary fistulae. Post-operative morbidity was lower in radical hysterectomy patients. There were two patients in the hysterectomy group who developed vault recurrence while none in the exenteration group had local recurrence. The median follow up time was 19 months (range 9-53 months).Three year overall survival for the entire cohort was 43 %. Median survival time for the exenteration group was 28 months which was significantly higher than 14 months for the radical hysterectomy group. This study shows that radical surgical resection is feasible with good survival outcome and acceptable morbidity in recurrent cancer cervix patients. Radical hysterectomy can be done in selected patients but pelvic exenteration has better long-term survival but with the potential for both short- & long-term complications.

Lack of nutrient dense foods and the prevailing food related disorder of obesity (Popkin, 2001; Prentice, 2014) especially render egg as a choice food to be value-added for attaining nutritional security in Saudi Arabia and in effect reverse the increasing incidences of lifestyle diseases. Nutritional intervention through a commonly consumed food product would be an important step in improving the health of the people, and reducing health care costs. As eggs are a frequently consumed food item in Saudi Arabia, enriching them with omega-3 fatty acids would be an excellent way to alleviate the existing problems. A significant deposition of omega-3 fatty acids in the eggs was observed when the diet of hens was supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids from either flaxseed or fish oil source. Inadequacy of omega-3 fatty acids could thus be rectified by producing omega-3 enriched eggs from hens supplemented with flaxseed or fish oil source, and thus contribute toward better health choice of the consumer.

VReconstruction of a Post Traumatic Anterior Maxillary Defect by Transport Distraction Osteogenesis.
p176
aVRehabilitation of segmental defects of maxilla presents a reconstructive challenge to obtain an ideal osseous form and height with adequate soft tissue investment. Though variety of prosthetic and surgical reconstructive options like the use of vascularized and non vascularized bone grafts are available they produce less than optimal results. Bone transport distraction is a reliable procedure in various maxillofacial bony defect reconstruction techniques. We describe herein a technique of maxillary bone transport distraction using an indigenously designed, custom made trifocal transport distractor performed in a post traumatic avulsive defect of the anterior maxilla. Transport distraction was successful for anterior maxillary alveolar bony regeneration, with excellent soft tissue cover and vestibular depth, which also helped close an oroantral/oronasal fistula.

aVAlthough laparoscopic repair offers a quick and less morbid way of treating hernias, complications like hematoma, seroma, neuralgia, recurrence, mesh infection, hydrocele, etc. are known. The present study was undertaken to compare various clinical outcomes between mesh fixation using fibrin glue and mesh fixation with tacker in a 3-months follow-up. One hundred patients aged 18 to 60 years having inguinal hernia admitted in Poona Hospital and Research Centre, Pune, between October 2012 and November 2014 for laparoscopic hernia surgery and ready to participate in this study were included. All of them underwent laparoscopic repair of hernia by total extra peritoneal (TEP) method following sample surgical protocol in all of them except for method of mesh fixation. Mean time calculated from insertion of the first trocar to beginning of skin suturing was 54.9 min in tacker group and 50.3 min in fibrin glue group with no statistically significant difference between the two. The incidence of urinary retention was significantly higher in tacker (34 %) as compared to fibrin glue (12 %) group. Incidence of hematoma was significantly higher in tacker group in 15-day follow-up, but there was no significant difference in hematoma formation at hernial sites in both groups after 15 days of follow-up. The incidence of neuralgia was significantly higher in the tacker group (24 %) compared with the fibrin glue group (2 %). Significantly, more number of people in the fibrin glue group 68 and 90 %, respectively, returned to work during 15 and 30 days follow-up as compared to the tacker group 46 and 64 %. Fibrin glue can be considered as an alternative to tacker for mesh fixation.

aVAdenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is an unusual salivary gland malignancy that remains poorly understood. It is a slow growing but aggressive neoplasm with a tendency for recurrence. It is characterized by the proliferation of ductal (luminal) and myoepithelial cells in cribriform, tubular, solid, and cystic forms. Standard treatment, including surgery with postoperative radiation therapy, has attained reasonable local control rates, but distant metastases do not allow any improvement in the survival rate. The understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving ACC is quite rudimentary. We present a case of a 55-year-old female diagnosed with ACC involving the floor of the mouth with an aim to present the carcinoma's behavior, immunohistocytochemistry, the staining pattern, its treatment, and prognosis.

VA study of distribution, sex differences and stability of lip print patterns in an Indian population.
p212
aVLip prints are very useful in forensic investigations. The objective of this study is to determine predominant lip print pattern found among a central Indian population, to evaluate whether any sex difference exists and to study the permanence of the pattern over a 6 month duration. This study included 200 healthy adult subjects comprising of 100 males and 100 females in the age group of 18-25 years. A convenient and easier method of data collection i.e., digital photography was used instead of the traditional lipstick methods. Lip prints were then divided into four quadrants and recognized as per Suzuki and Tsuchihashi's classification. Type I (30.63%) was found to be most predominant overall in the Marathi population. Type I (29.75%) and Type III (35.75%) were found most prevalent in males and females respectively. Applying the Chi-Square test, statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between male and female lip print patterns in each of the quadrants individually and all quadrants taken together. The lip print patterns remained stable over a period of six-months. Being stable and with significant sex differences, lip prints can be effectively used as an important tool in forensic investigations for individualization as well as identification of sex of the donor, thus, narrowing down the scope of investigation to almost half.

aVPreeclampsia is a serious medical complication during pregnancy. In response to an increasing number of preeclamptic cases and scarcity of data concerning the interrelation between trace element levels and preeclampsia, we carried out a hospital based case-control study in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to study the correlation between levels of serum trace elements and risk of preeclampsia. One hundred and twenty pregnant women were enrolled in this study and divided into three groups of 40 each-Control group, HR group (women at high risk of preeclampsia) and PET group (Preeclampsia group). Serum trace element levels were estimated by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrophotometer. The analysis found that mean values of Ca, Mg and Zn were 90.08 ± 6.38, 19.33 ± 3.32 and 1.30 ± 0.83 mg/L respectively in normotensive control and 77.85 ± 4.47, 15.44 ± 1.43 and 0.98 ± 0.63 mg/L respectively in the HR group. The mean values of Ca, Mg and Zn in the preeclamptic group were 70.37 ± 4.66, 13.58 ± 1.98 and 0.67 ± 0.59 mg/L, respectively. Interelement analysis reflected a negative correlation between Ca and Mg and between Mg and Zn whereas positive correlation between Ca and Zn in preeclamptic women. However the correlation was not statistically significant. In conclusion, our study suggests that decreased levels of these trace elements in serum may act as predisposing factors in pathogenesis of Preeclampsia.

Among the recovered cymothoids, 11 species were branchial residents belonging to 6 genera; the species include Agarna malayi, Catoessa gruneri, C. boscii, Joryma hilsae, J. brachysoma, J. engraulidis, J. sawayah, Mothocya collettei, M. renardi, Norileca indica and Ryukyua circularis; highest prevalence being exhibited by two species of Mothocya, (M. renardi and M. collettei) parasitizing the belonidaen fishes, Strongylura leiura (92.15 %) and Tylosurus crocodilus crocodilus (87.2 %) respectively. Except Mothocya species, which preferred the branchial floor for infestation, all recovered branchial cymothoids were found attached the inner wall of the operculum. In several instances, the parasites appeared in male-female pairs, one in each branchial cavity. Ovigerous female members of all species of branchial cymothoids except R. circularis showed remarkable bending either towards left or right depending on whether they are located in right or left branchial cavity of their respective host fishes. The deleterious effects of parasitization by all recovered branchial cymothoids include the formation of a pit like depression in the branchial chamber and atrophy of the gill filament; the damage was more pronounced in the gill cavity of parasitized host fishes where the ovigerous female member was accommodated.

VIn silico sequence analysis, homology modeling and function annotation of leishmanolysin from Leishmania donovani.
p239
aVLeishmaniases are a complex of diseases that range from the deadly visceral disease and some self-curing lesions to gross disfigurations. About 12 million peoples from 88 different countries get infected by this protozoan parasite through the sand flies. Visceral leishmaniasis is a potentially fatal disease endemic to large parts of Asia and Africa, primarily caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. L. donovani is a species of Leishmania, a hemoflagellate parasite and causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis. Leishmanolysin is the major surface protein of the parasitic Leishmania. Leishmanolysin has been described as a parasite virulence factor and is involved in the direct interaction of promastigotes and host macrophage receptors and interaction with the complement cascade. In the current study we predicted the 3D structure of leishmanolysin using homology modeling as 3D structure prediction approach. Leishmanolysin is a stable extracellular stable protein of 561 amino acid residues. 3D structure of the leishmanolysin was determined using Protein Structure Prediction Server (PS2 Server) selecting MODELLER as 3D structure prediction method. Quality analysis of the model through its Ramchandran Plot and ERRAT value (94.25) indicated that it is a reliable model. Functional annotation showed that this protein is a member of the superfamily cl18220. The information thus discussed provides insight to the molecular understanding of structure and function of leishmanolysin from L. donovani. The predicted 3-D model may be further used in characterizing the protein in wet laboratory.

aVThe aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro and in vivo anticestodal effects of methanol extract of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L. (Malvaceae) leaf against Hymenolepis diminuta (Rudolphi, 1819), a zoonotic tapeworm. Under the in vitro study, H. diminuta worms were exposed to 10, 20 and 40 mg/ml concentrations of methanol leaf extract and the effects were judged on the basis of physical motility/mortality of worms. On the other hand, in the case of in vivo study, H. diminuta infected rats were treated individually with 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg doses of leaf extract for 5 days. The effects were judged on the basis of reduction in eggs per gram (EPG) of faeces and worm counts. In case of in vitro test, the treatment with 40 mg/ml concentration of extract revealed prominent anticestodal effect and caused paralysis of worms in 3.00 ± 0.53 h and mortality in 4.08 ± 0.21 h. However, under in vivo study, the 800 mg/kg dose of extract revealed the highest anticestodal effect and caused 66.55 % reduction in EPG count and 75.00 % reduction in worm count in the treated animals. The results of this study indicated that H. rosa-sinesis leaf extract possesses concentration-dependent anticestodal effect against H. diminuta, indicating that the plant possesses promising active principle for the control of intestinal helminthic infections.

The structure of the compounds was elucidated by elemental and spectral (IR, (1)H NMR and MS) analysis. The synthesized compounds (at a dose of 20 mg/kg b.wt. p.o.) have shown their ability to provide 45.1-81.7% protection against carrageenan-induced paw edema, in comparison with diclofenac sodium (69.5%) and ibuprofen (64.7%). The most active compounds 3a, 3l and 3n were screened for chronic anti-inflammatory activity (cotton-pellet-induced granuloma) and to study their ulcerogenic activity. Compounds 3a, 3l and 3n showed 48.4%, 39.3% and 44.0% protection against cotton pellets-induced granuloma compared to diclofenac sodium (60.2%). The tested compounds were less ulcerogenic than the ibuprofen. Molecular modeling studies suggest that these compounds have strong interaction with the COX-2 enzyme, which is responsible for the activity.

VA prospective study of haematological changes after switching from stavudine to zidovudine-based antiretroviral treatment in HIV-infected children.
p284
aVLong-term use of stavudine is associated with a high incidence of lipodystrophy, warranting its substitution with zidovudine in first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens. In a prospective observational study, we determined the spectrum and severity of haematological changes after switching from stavudine- to zidovudine-based ART in Indian children aged 2-18 years who had received a stavudine-based ART regimen for at least 48 weeks. They were followed for 48 weeks for changes in haematological parameters and CD4 cell counts after switching to zidovudine. Of the 60 children analysed, 45 (75%) showed a significant fall in Hb (>1\u2009g/dl). A majority developed grade 1 anaemia (14 [31%]) while only three (6%) developed grade 4 anaemia. The lowest Hb was recorded between 12 and 16 weeks with spontaneous improvement noticed after 28 weeks. A significant drop in absolute neutrophil count (5067 cells/mm(3) to 3625 cells/mm(3); p\u2009=\u20090.004) was also observed but none developed severe neutropenia. No significant changes were observed in platelet and CD4 cell counts. Since the incidence of severe drug toxicity was low with zidovudine and the majority of children recovered without intervention, drug toxicity should not preclude its routine use in poor countries.

aVProtozoal infections are common in the tropics. Amoebic colitis is the commonest of these infections and can lead to liver abscess as a complication. Balantidium coli is a rare free moving protozoal parasite which is known to infest human large intestine causing a type of colitis very similar to that caused by Entamoeba histolytica. However this pathogen is not known to cause liver invasion in humans. We report here a case of liver abscess caused by B. coli, which is probably the first such case reported in Indian literature.

VNanogels as potential nanomedicine carrier for treatment of cancer: A mini review of the state of the art.
p295
aVNanogels are being explored as drug delivery agents for targeting cancer due to their easy tailoring properties and ability to efficiently encapsulate therapeutics of diverse nature through simple mechanisms. Nanogels are proficiently internalized by the target cells, avoid accumulating in nontarget tissues thereby lower the therapeutic dosage and minimize harmful side effects. However, there is an urgent need for relevant clinical data from nanogels so as to allow translation of the nanogel concept into a viable therapeutic application for the treatment of cancer. This review highlights some of the recent progress in nanogels as a carrier in the field of nanomedicine for the treatment of cancer. The present review critically analyzes the use of extracellular pH targeting for nanogels, siRNA delivery, PEGylated nanogels, multi-responsive nanogels and intracellular delivery of nanogels for improved therapy of cancer.

VTumours of Deep Lobe of Parotid Gland: Our Experience.
p313
aVParotidectomy surgeries are being routinely performed by ENT surgeons nowadays. Parotid tumours can present with a variety of manifestations ranging from a barely noticeable mass to a large tumour with facial paralysis. Most benign parotid tumours are located in the superficial lobe though rarely deep lobe may also be involved, while malignant tumours are generally seen to involve both the lobes of the gland. We present clinico-radiological-pathological profile of 25 patients who underwent parotid surgeries for tumours involving deep lobe alone or the whole gland, and were operated at our institute during the period from January 2011 to December 2012. This study was a retroprospective observational analysis with the aim of analyzing the epidemiology, radiological, surgical and histopathological profile of these patients. Among 25 patients who underwent parotid surgeries, 17 patients underwent total conservative parotidectomy, while 5 patients underwent radical parotidectomy. In 3 patients, extended radical parotidectomy was performed. We also report the complications and follow-up of these patients. We concluded that fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) findings and final histopathological report may not always correlate.

VLaparoscopic Management of Hydatid Cyst of Liver with Palanivelu Hydatid System over a Period of 3 Years: A Case Series of 32 Patients.
p316
aVThe aim of this article is to evaluate the role and safety of laparoscopic management of hydatid disease of liver using Palanivelu hydatid system (PHS)(1) with initial results. A prospective study of hepatic hydatid cyst underwent laparoscopic management using PHS, during the period from June 2008 to October 2010, in department of general surgery in a tertiary care institute. Selective patients were included in our study. Preoperatively 2 weeks and post operatively 6 weeks of Albendazole were given. All patients underwent surgery under general anesthesia. Hydatid cyst evacuation and omentoplasty were done with PHS system to prevent spillage. Cyst was irrigated with 2 % savlon. Drainage tube was kept near the cyst. There were 32 patients with 35 liver hydatid cysts operated. The mean operative time was 93.78 (70-180)\u2009min. Intraoperative complications were noted in two patients (6.2 %). Conversion was required in one patient (3.1 %). The mean duration of hospital stay was 3-10 days with an average of 5 days. There was no recurrence in mean follow-up of 3 years. There was no mortality with good subjective and objective cosmetic results. The laparoscopic cyst evacuation and omentoplasty using PHS are feasible and safe for treating the hydatid cyst of liver in selected patients. It aids early recovery with good cosmetic results.

VNegative Appendectomy: an Audit of Resident-Performed Surgery. How Can Its Incidence Be Minimized?
p319
aVNegative appendectomy remains a concern in current surgical practice. Data from the developing world is scarce. Data of appendectomies during the last 5 years were analyzed. Interval and incidental appendectomies were excluded. The demographic details, presenting complaints, clinical signs, and investigations performed were recorded in a predesigned proforma. The data were critically analyzed. Six hundred eighty-five appendectomies were performed during the period. One hundred eighty-five patients with a normal appendix were identified on histopathology. Sixty-seven patients with incidental or interval appendectomies were excluded. Thus, 118 patients had appendectomies performed erroneously. All these patients with presumed diagnosis of acute appendicitis were operated on by resident surgeons. Records of 17 patients could not be retrieved. The most common symptom was abdominal pain (100 %), and the commonest sign was right iliac fossa tenderness (93 %). Most of the patients underwent USG to supplement the diagnosis. CT scan and diagnostic laparoscopy were not performed. The negative appendectomy rate was 17.2 % (12.4 % in males; 33.3 % in females). The highest incidence of negative appendectomy was in females aged 11-20 years (66.7 %). The rate of negative appendectomy at our institute is comparable with the world statistics. More diligence is required in making the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis, especially in young females. The use of C-reactive protein and CT scan may decrease the negative appendectomy rate.

aVGlomus tumor is a benign vascular tumor derived from the modified smooth muscle cells of the glomus body. The single most common site is the subungual region of the finger, but other common sites include the palm, wrist, forearm, and foot. In this article, we present a rare situation of glomus tumor occurring on the back of the chest over the scapular area in an elderly male patient. The tumor cells exhibited positive expression for CD34 and smooth muscle actin. This paper highlights the fact that a glomus tumor is a benign neoplasm that may occur in multiple locations. Therefore, the significance of a histological and immunohistochemical approach for a correct characterization of this lesion is required.

aVThe aim of this study was to evaluate the morbidity and survival outcome following radical hysterectomy after chemoradiotherapy in the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages IB-IIB cervical cancer patients in whom intracavitory brachytherapy was not feasible. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of our patients who underwent adjuvant radical hysterectomy between January 2005 and December 2012. Post-operative complications were graded according to the grading system of Chassagne et al. (Radiother Oncol 26:195-202, 1993). Survival analysis was done using Kaplan-Meir method. Between January 2005 and December 2012, 43 patients underwent type 2 radical hysterectomy after external beam radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy. The median age of the study group was 44 years (range 28-63 years). There were no perioperative deaths. In the early post-operative period, there were 45 complications in 29 patients of which three were of grade 3 severity. The most common post operative complications were urinary tract infections and lymphoedema. The median follow-up time was 29 months (range 9-68 months). The 5-year overall survival was 85.5 % and disease-free survival 82.1 %. This study shows that radical hysterectomy is feasible with good survival outcome and acceptable morbidity after chemoradiotherapy in cervical cancer patients.

VCalot's Triangle: Proposal to Rename it as Calot's Region and the Concept of 'Ducto-Arterial Plane'.
p328
aVThe anatomical description of the area requiring dissection during cholecystectomy is incomplete and incorrect. We carefully observed the anatomy of this region for over 20 years in various biliary pathologies and present our view. Describing this area in the form of triangles is incorrect. There exists a definite plane between the two folds of peritoneum in this region, wherein the cystic duct and the cystic artery traverse. The description of the "triangles" that require dissection during cholecystectomy are not strictly geometrical triangles; hence, the area bounded by these so-called triangles should be renamed as "Calot's region." The surgeons should take advantage of the existence of a definite "ducto-arterial plane" in the Calot's region and dissect it sharply to avoid ductal and vascular injuries.

VComparison of Cosmetic Outcome Between Single-Incision Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy and Conventional Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy in Rural Indian Population: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
p331
aVPersistent efforts are being made to reduce operative trauma and morbidity and to improve cosmesis following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The trend is to reduce the number of incisions, and thus single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) and natural orifice endoscopic surgery (NOTES) are becoming popular. There is a paucity of studies pertaining to cosmetic outcome after SILC and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy in rural Indian population. In the present study, the cosmetic outcome of SILC versus conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC) in rural Indian population was evaluated. Sixty patients with gallstone disease were randomly assigned to two groups. In group A (n\u2009=\u200930), CLC was performed, while group B (n\u2009=\u200930) was subjected to SILC. The cosmetic outcome was evaluated using a body image questionnaire on the 7th and 30th postoperative days. On the 7th postoperative day, the body image score for SILC was 6.23\u2009±\u20090.89 and for CLC, 8.26\u2009±\u20091.08 (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), while the cosmetic score for SILC was 19.56\u2009±\u20091.07 and for CLC, 15\u2009±\u20091.20 (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). On the 30th postoperative day, the body image score for SILC was 5.50\u2009±\u20090.68 and for CLC, 8\u2009±\u20091.31 (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), while the cosmetic score for SILC was 21.13\u2009±\u20090.57 and for CLC, 15.63\u2009±\u20091.06 (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), which favored SILC over CLC. The patient perception and acceptance of SILC was better than that of CLC in terms of cosmetic outcome.

VDermoid cysts of maxillofacial region.
p344
aVThe dermoid cyst is an uncommon clinicopathological lesion of developmental origin. The term dermoid cyst is used to describe 3 cysts that are closely related histologically: dermoid cyst, epidermoid cyst, and teratoma. Epidermoid and dermoid cysts are benign nature, which may occur anywhere in the body, but most predominantly in the ovary and scrotal regions. Only about 7% are found in the head and neck. The occurrence of such cysts in the oral cavity is extremely rare, with approximately 1.6% located in this area. The floor of the mouth is one of the most commonly affected area, however, these cysts can also be found in the tongue, lips, buccal mucosa and jaw bones. There is always a difficulty of making a correct diagnosis of these lesions with clinical examinations and conventional radiography. To achieve a diagnosis and to develop correct surgical strategy specialized imaging examinations such as ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and histopathological examination should be carried out. Treatment comprises total surgical excision the approach remains dictated logically by the cyst's location. Ample understanding and vigilance about this slow growing painless mass is essential not only because of the symptoms it produces but also due to its malignant potential. When dermoid cysts occur on the floor of the mouth, they may enlarge to such an extent that they can interfere with deglutition and produce respiratory obstruction. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for these cystic entities.

aVAlthough a number of studies have been undertaken to evaluate the friction characteristics of self-ligating brackets, there have been only few studies which have actually evaluated the clinical efficiency of these self-ligating brackets. This study was done to evaluate the clinical efficiency of Passive SLB (Smart Clip) in terms of anchorage loss and total treatment duration by comparing it with a Conventional pre-adjusted edgewise (M.B.T.) bracket system.This was a retrospective study in which the study sample comprised of ten patients treated with Passive SLB (Smart Clip, 0.022\u2033) and ten patients treated with Conventional pre-adjusted edgewise (M.B.T.) bracket system (0.022\u2033) who required therapeutic extraction of U/L first premolars as a part of their orthodontic treatment plan. Pretreatment and post treatment lateral cephalograms were taken to evaluate the amount of anchorage loss. The total time required to complete the treatment was also recorded.Anchorage loss observed with Passive SLB (Smart Clip) sagittally was 1.90 ± 0.68 mm in the maxilla and 1.90 ± 0.43 mm in the mandible and vertically was 0.52 ± 0.53 mm in the maxilla and 0.70 ± 0.69 mm in the mandible. Anchorage loss observed with Conventional pre-adjusted edgewise (M.B.T.) bracket system sagittally was 2.08 ± 0.43 mm in the maxilla and 1.95 ± 0.44 mm in the mandible and vertically was 0.50 ± 0.49 mm in the maxilla and 0.68 ± 0.53 mm in the mandible. The average time taken for the completion of treatment in Passive SLB (Smart Clip) and Conventional pre-adjusted edgewise (M.B.T.) bracket system was 14.0 ± 2.4 and 17.2 ± 2.6 months respectively.There was no statistically significant difference in the quantum of anchor loss between Smart Clip self-ligating bracket system and Conventional pre-adjusted edgewise (M.B.T.) bracket system although Smart Clip self-ligating bracket system is efficient in reducing the overall treatment time.

aVMidfacial growth retardation in cleft lip and palate (CLP) cases, is seen in all the three dimensions. Conventionally these cases are managed by orthographic surgery which has a high rate of relapse. The application of the distraction osteogenesis (DO) has revolutionized the management protocol. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of rigid external distractor (RED) in management of cleft induced maxillary hypoplasia.Ten cases of unilateral CLP between 11 and 20 years of age having gross midfacial deficiency and those who have undergone presurgical orthodontic treatment were included in the study. The cases were operated for Le Fort 1 osteotomy and application of RED. DO was carried out through transnasal traction wires. Clinico-radiological evaluation of presurgical and 1, 6 and 12 months post distraction parameters were statistically analysed by application of paired 't'-test.There were 4 males and 6 females with a mean age of 15.1 years. The mean distraction carried out was 14.95 mm. There was a significant improvement in all the hard and soft tissue parameters except SNB. Facial profile improvement and stable occlusion was achieved in all the cases.Midfacial DO using RED is a versatile procedure where the maxilla can be moved in multiple planes to achieve a functional, aesthetic and occlusal balance. Keeping in view of the significant relapse rate the clinicians are required to plan 15-20% excess amount of distraction.

aVSurface roughness of nickel titanium orthodontic arch wires poses several clinical challenges. Surface modification with aesthetic/metallic/non metallic materials is therefore a recent innovation, with clinical efficacy yet to be comprehensively evaluated.One conventional and five types of surface modified nickel titanium arch wires were surface characterized with scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive analysis, Raman spectroscopy, Atomic force microscopy and 3D profilometry. Root mean square roughness values were analyzed by one way analysis of variance and post hoc Duncan's multiple range tests.Study groups demonstrated considerable reduction in roughness values from conventional in a material specific pattern: Group I; conventional (578.56 nm) > Group V; Teflon (365.33 nm) > Group III; nitride (301.51 nm) > Group VI (i); rhodium (290.64 nm) > Group VI (ii); silver (252.22 nm) > Group IV; titanium (229.51 nm) > Group II; resin (158.60 nm). It also showed the defects with aesthetic (resin/Teflon) and nitride surfaces and smooth topography achieved with metals; titanium/silver/rhodium.Resin, Teflon, titanium, silver, rhodium and nitrides were effective in decreasing surface roughness of nickel titanium arch wires albeit; certain flaws. Findings have clinical implications, considering their potential in lessening biofilm adhesion, reducing friction, improving corrosion resistance and preventing nickel leach and allergic reactions.

aVAttempts to shorten the overall length of treatment have focused on immediate loading, subsequent to implant placement. Prosthetic rehabilitation immediately after implant placement can be either functional or non-functional in nature. There is paucity of literature on the comparative evaluation of immediate functional and immediate non-functional loading of implants. This in-vivo study was undertaken to comparatively evaluate Immediate Functional Loading and Immediate Non-Functional Loading of monocortical implants with a follow-up period of 18 months.50 partially edentulous cases were selected for the study. The cases were divided into two groups. In first group (Group-1), 25 implants were subjected to immediate functional loading. In second group (Group-2), 25 implants were subjected to immediate non-functional loading. The crestal bone loss, clinical stability and degree of osseointegration of these two groups were comparatively evaluated.The crestal bone loss in both groups was within acceptable limits. The implant stability, which is a reflection of the status of bone-to-implant interface, was comparable in both the groups at different time intervals. Although, the ISQ values in Group-2 were slightly higher than those in Group-1, the results were not statistically significant. Radiodensity indicating degree of osseointegration at different time intervals in both groups was also comparable.Both the IFL and INFL protocols can be undertaken satisfactorily in rehabilitation using endosseous implants; however, the main factors for success in IFL and INFL are case selection, meticulous treatment planning and the precision of technique.

VExtended-Spectrum \u03b2-Lactamase-Producing and Third-Generation Cephalosporin-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae in Children: Trends in the United States, 1999-2011.
p362
aVEnterobacteriaceae infections resistant to extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactams are an emerging problem in children. We used a large database of clinical isolates to describe the national epidemiology of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant (G3CR) Enterobacteriaceae.Antimicrobial susceptibilities of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis reported to \u223c300 laboratories participating in The Surveillance Network (TSN) between January 1999 and December 2011 were used to phenotypically identify G3CR and ESBL isolates cultured from patients <18 years. Bi-annual trends in the prevalence of each phenotype were stratified by species, patient location, culture site, age, and region. Children of age 0-1 years were excluded from analysis as data were only available from 2010 onwards.Out of 368,398 pediatric isolates, 1.97% (7255) were identified as G3CR, and 0.47% (1734) as ESBL producers. The prevalence of both phenotypes increased, respectively, from 1.39% and 0.28% in 1999-2001 to 3% and 0.92% in 2010-2011. Trends were significant across all demographic and age groups, including outpatients, with the highest proportion of isolates in the 1-5-year-old age group. The majority of G3CR and ESBL isolates were E. coli (67.8% and 65.2%, respectively). Among ESBLs, resistance to \u22653 antibiotic classes was 74%. The lower regional prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria in the upper Midwest relative to the rest of the country is consistent with recent local data.Rates of G3CR and ESBL infections in children are increasing in both inpatient and ambulatory settings nationally. The identification of host factors and exposures leading to infection in children is essential.

VExtended-Spectrum \u03b2-Lactamase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae Infections in Children: A Two-Center Case-Case-Control Study of Risk Factors and Outcomes in Chicago, Illinois.
p365
aVExtended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae infections are an emerging problem in children. We sought to identify risk factors and describe outcomes associated with pediatric ESBL-producing bacterial infections at 2 hospitals in Chicago, IL from 2008 to 2011.A case-case-control study of children aged 0-17 years was conducted. Cases of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Proteus spp. ESBL-producing bacterial infections (n = 30) were compared to uninfected controls and in parallel, cases of non-ESBL-producing bacterial infections (n = 30) were compared to uninfected controls (n = 60). We then qualitatively compared these results.Median age of cases was 1.06 years; 62% of isolates were from urine, and 60% were E. coli. By multivariable analysis, ESBL cases were 5.7 and 3.3 times more likely to have gastrointestinal (P = .001; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-17.0) and neurologic (P = .001; 95% CI 1.1-3.7) comorbidities, respectively, than controls; non-ESBL cases were also more likely to have gastrointestinal comorbidities than controls (P = .014; odds ratio 3.6; 95% CI 1.2-10.1). Study period prevalence remained stable (1.7%). Most (60%) infections occurred in the intensive care unit; however, 30% of children presented in the outpatient setting. Seventy-seven percent of isolates were multidrug resistant (ie, resistant to \u22653 antibiotic classes). Recurrence of infection occurred in 17% of ESBL cases. Crude mortality rates (7%) did not differ between cases and controls.The incidence of pediatric infection due to ESBL-positive Enterobacteriaceae was stable at 2 large tertiary-care medical centers over a 4-year period. Multidrug resistance in pediatric ESBL isolates is common. Risk factors for infection due to ESBL-producing bacteria include neurologic medical conditions.

VPrincipal component analysis of cardiovascular risk traits in three generations cohort among Indian Punjabi population.
p368
aVThe current study focused to determine significant cardiovascular risk factors through principal component factor analysis (PCFA) among three generations on 1827 individuals in three generations including 911 males (378 from offspring, 439 from parental and 94 from grand-parental generations) and 916 females (261 from offspring, 515 from parental and 140 from grandparental generations). The study performed PCFA with orthogonal rotation to reduce 12 inter-correlated variables into groups of independent factors. The factors have been identified as 2 for male grandparents, 3 for male offspring, female parents and female grandparents each, 4 for male parents and 5 for female offspring. This data reduction method identified these factors that explained 72%, 84%, 79%, 69%, 70% and 73% for male and female offspring, male and female parents and male and female grandparents respectively, of the variations in original quantitative traits. The factor 1 accounting for the largest portion of variations was strongly loaded with factors related to obesity (body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio (WHR), and thickness of skinfolds) among all generations with both sexes, which has been known to be an independent predictor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The second largest components, factor 2 and factor 3 for almost all generations reflected traits of blood pressure phenotypes loaded, however, in male offspring generation it was observed that factor 2 was loaded with blood pressure phenotypes as well as obesity. This study not only confirmed but also extended prior work by developing a cumulative risk scale from factor scores. Till today, such a cumulative and extensive scale has not been used in any Indian studies with individuals of three generations. These findings and study highlight the importance of global approach for assessing the risk and need for studies that elucidate how these different cardiovascular risk factors interact with each other over the time to create clinical disease. The findings also added depth to the negligible amount of literature of factor analysis of cardiovascular risk in any Indian ethnic population.

We evaluated the QuantiFERON-Gold-in-tube assay (QFT) and tuberculin skin test (TST) in children with different types of TB exposure.The TST and QFT were performed in referred TB-exposed children and adolescents who had not undergone prior TST screening (tested in parallel), and the QFT was performed in referred TST-positive individuals. Source case characteristics were obtained from referring public health units. We excluded children with known immunocompromising conditions and those known to have TB disease at the time of evaluation.For 103 patients tested in parallel, overall test agreement was very good in the Bacillus Calmette-Guerein (BCG) unimmunized contacts (\u03ba = 0.83) and contacts of household smear-positive (HS+) cases (\u03ba = 0.67), but test agreement was poor in those with lower-risk contact (\u03ba = 0.34). Only 3 of 59 HS+ patients were QFT-positive and TST-negative. On multivariate analysis, a positive QFT was strongly associated with HS+ exposure (odds ratio [OR], 6.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-20]) but not BCG; and a positive TST was associated with BCG alone. For 92 referred TST-positive individuals, the QFT was negative in 21% of HS+ contacts, 65% of lower-risk contacts (OR, 6.8; 95% CI, 1.9-25), and 82% of the patients with unknown contact history (OR, 15.5; 95% CI, 5-54). Application of the Canadian 2010 guidelines would exclude from treatment 43 (72%) of the 73 TST+, QFT- patients.For close contacts of HS+ individuals, the QFT added little sensitivity to the TST for detection of TB infection. The QFT correlated much better with exposure than the TST, especially in BCG-immunized children, and it has the greatest potential benefit for evaluation of those at lower risk of latent TB infection.

VAllergic Rhinitis in Children: A Randomized Clinical Trial Targeted at Symptoms.
p376
aVAllergic rhinitis (AR) underlies many symptoms and complications which severely affect children's quality of life. This two-arm study aimed at evaluate the efficacy and safety of the medical device Narivent(®) versus topical corticosteroids in the symptomatic management of allergic rhinitis in paediatric patients. A randomized study was conducted. Forty subjects with a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis were randomized to receive one puff of Narivent(®) into each nostril twice daily for 30 days (n = 20) or to receive one puff of topical intranasal corticosteroid into each nostril twice daily for 30 days (n = 20). In both treatment arms, severity of major symptoms related to AR, including nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, sneezing and nasal itching, was assessed subjectively on a 0-100 mm visual analogue scale. Nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and sneezing improved significantly after 30 days of treatment with Narivent(®). Similarly, in topical steroids group severity of all subjective symptoms decreased significantly. Narivent(®) appears to be efficacious in treating nasal congestion and other major symptoms in children with AR over a 30-day period, showing comparable results to intranasal corticosteroids therapy but with a better safety profile.

VAnastomotic Recurrence of Colon Cancer-is it a Local Recurrence, a Second Primary, or a Metastatic Disease (Local Manifestation of Systemic Disease)?
p405
aVThe aim of this study is to review the literature to find out the exact etiology of anastomotic cancers of colon post resection and differentiate them between a recurrence, second primary, and metastatic disease (local manifestation of systemic disease). Web-based literature search was done, and datas collected. We searched PubMed for papers using the keywords colon cancer recurrence, anastomotic recurrence, and recurrent colon carcinoma. We also searched for systematic review in the same topic. In addition, we used our personal referrence archive. Anastomotic recurrences of colon are postulated to arise due to inadequate margins, tumor implantation by exfoliated cells, altered biological properties of bowel anastomosis, and missed synchronous lesions. Some tumors are unique with repeated recurrence after repeated resection. Duration after primary surgery plays a major role in differentiating recurrent and second primary lesions. Repeated recurrences after repeated resections have to be considered a manifestation of systemic disease or metastatic disease due to the virulence of the disease. A detailed analysis and study of patients with colonic anastomotic lesion are required to differentiate it between a recurrent, a second primary lesion, and a metastatic disease (local manifestation of a systemic disease). The nomenclature is significant to study the survival of these patients, as a second primary lesion will have different survival compared to that of recurrent lesions.

VAcinar Cell Carcinoma of the Pancreas: A Literature Review and Update.
p408
aVPancreatic acinar cell carcinoma is a rare tumour, accounting for only about 1 % of all pancreatic tumours. The long-term survival for patients with acinar cell carcinoma is significantly better than the long-term survival of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. As no large series of patients with acinar cell carcinomas exist, our understanding of this disease comes mainly from small case series and case reports. Aggressive surgical resection with negative margins is associated with long-term survival in these more favourable pancreatic cancers. There are no clear treatment guidelines for patients in whom complete surgical resection with curative intent is not possible. Acinar cell carcinomas are chemoresponsive to agents that have activity against pancreatic adenocarcinomas and colorectal carcinomas because of the shared genetic alterations between these cancers. The role of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy remains unproven. The aim of this article is to present current knowledge on acinar cell carcinoma and comprehensive review of available literature.

VLiver dialysis in acute-on-chronic liver failure: current and future perspectives.
p411
aVPatients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) are known to have a very high mortality rate as the majority of these patients succumb to multiorgan failure. Liver transplant remains the only option for these patients; however, there are problems with its availability, cost and also the complications and side effects associated with immunosuppression. Unlike advanced decompensated liver disease, there is a potential for hepatic regeneration and recovery in patients with ACLF. A liver support system, cell or non-cell based, logically is likely to provide temporary functional support until the donor liver becomes available or the failing liver survives the onslaught of the acute insult and spontaneously regenerates. Understanding the pathogenesis of liver failure and regeneration is essential to define the needs for a support system. Removal of hepatotoxic metabolites and inhibitors of hepatic regeneration by liver dialysis, a non-cell-based hepatic support, could help to provide a suitable microenvironment and support the failing liver. The current systems, i.e., MARS and Prometheus, have failed to show survival benefits in patients with ACLF based on which newer devices with improved functionality are currently under development. However, larger randomized trials are needed to prove whether these devices can enable restoration of the complex dysregulated immune system and impact organ failure and mortality in these patients.

aVThe evaluation of liquefaction potential of soil due to an earthquake is an important step in geosciences. This article examines the capability of Minimax Probability Machine (MPM) for the prediction of seismic liquefaction potential of soil based on the Cone Penetration Test (CPT) data. The dataset has been taken from Chi-Chi earthquake. MPM is developed based on the use of hyperplanes. It has been adopted as a classification tool. This article uses two models (MODEL I and MODEL II). MODEL I employs Cone Resistance (q c) and Cyclic Stress Ratio (CSR) as input variables. q c and Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) have been taken as inputs for MODEL II. The developed MPM gives 100% accuracy. The results show that the developed MPM can predict liquefaction potential of soil based on q c and PGA.

aVLarge cranial defects of complex geometric shapes are challenging to reconstruct. The cranial implants has to be fabricated prior to the cranioplastic surgery. The ideal material for cranial implant has to be inert, light weight, easy to fit and adaptable to the defect, offering the best aesthetic and functional results. Here is a clinical case report of a patient who was operated for osteomyelitis in the parieto-temporal region. The defect was reconstructed with heat cure polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Operative closure of the defect was facilitated with ligature titanium wires with minimal prosthesis contouring. The heat cure PMMA cranial implant is a safe, easy and economic alternative with great adaptability to cranial vault defects. The cosmetic results in this patient was excellent.

aVGiant cell granulomas of the jaws are lesions that arise either peripherally in periodontal ligament, mucoperiosteum, or centrally in the bone. Histologically, both peripheral and central giant cell granuloma are characterized by the presence of numerous multinucleated giant cells in a prominent fibrous stroma. Traditional treatment has been local curettage, although aggressive sub-types have a high tendency to recur. This case report describes the rehabilitation procedure of a patient with central giant cell granuloma of left side of mandible. Marginal resection of the lesion was done followed by reconstruction of the resected mandible with iliac graft. Distraction of bone was done since there was partial uptake of the fibula graft. Five implants were placed once the distraction was complete. The patient was rehabilitated with implant retained removable telescopic prosthesis.

VA Sectional Splint for Maintaining Surgically Enhanced Vertical Height in an Oral Submucous Fibrosis Patient: A Case Report.
p432
aVOral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) is a chronic inflammatory disease that results in a progressive juxtaepithelial fibrosis of the oral soft tissues, causing an increasing difficulty in mouth opening, chewing, swallowing and speaking. It is regarded as a precancerous and potentially malignant condition. The fibrosis of oral mucosa leads to limited mouth opening and difficulty in mastication. Prosthetic rehabilitation of patients with OSMF offers a formidable challenge due to the restricted mouth opening. Management of the limited mouth opening is usually by surgery. Herein, we describe a procedure to maintain the increased mouth opening that is achieved through surgery. Maintaining this opening would make it easier for any further prosthetic rehabilitation at a later stage.

VComparison of Marginal Gap and Microleakage in Copy-Milled and Cad-Milled Zirconia Copings Bonded Using Light Cure and Chemical Cure Resin Bonding Systems.
p435
aVThis in vitro study assessed the marginal gap and marginal microleakage in zirconia copings fabricated using two computer aided techniques- CAD milling and Copy milling and cemented to respective tooth preparations using two resin bonding systems, light cure and self-cure resin bonding systems. 32 extracted premolars were prepared to receive zirconia copings fabricated using CAD/CAM and Copy milling techniques. Once the copings were fabricated, the samples were evaluated for marginal fit prior to cementation through microscopic observation. Evaluation of marginal gap was done again after cementation, in order to incorporate the influence of the resin bonding system on the marginal microgap. The specimens were evaluated under the stereomicroscope for micro-leakage using commercial software. A comparative statistical analysis was done following data collection using Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon test and chi-square test. The data collected regarding marginal gap was well within 120 µ, which is in accordance with previous studies. However, Copy milled specimens showed statistically lesser marginal gap when compared to CAD milled specimens. While comparing microleakage, it was observed that the microleakage in Copy milled specimens bonded with light cure resin bonded cement was statistically lesser than that of specimens cemented with chemical cure resin cement.(P = 0.003). This in vitro study concluded that Copy milling technique fabricated zirconia restorations with lesser marginal gap and microleakage score in comparison to CAD milled samples. Light cure resin bonding system also proved to be more effective option compared to self cure resin bonding systems. However, the limitations of this study should be taken into concern and further research should be aimed at a larger sample size to validate the results.

aVAnopheles culicifacies is an important vector of malaria in Southeast Asia, contributing to almost 70% of malaria cases in India. It exists as a complex of five morphologically indistinguishable species A, B, C, D and E with varied geographical distribution patterns. In India, 8% of the total population of Madhya Pradesh (Central India) contributes about 30% of total malaria cases, 60% of total falciparum cases and 50% of malaria deaths. An. culicifacies is the major malaria vector in this state. Vector control mainly relies on the proper identification and distribution of vector species exists in a particular area. The present study was carried out to identify the distribution of An. culicifacies sibling species in certain endemic district of Central India, Madhya Pradesh.The An. culicifacies mosquitoes collected from the study districts were identified morphologically. The genomic DNA was isolated from the mosquitoes and subjected to Allele specific PCR targeting D3 domain of 28S ribosomal DNA.The mean prevalence of An. culicifacies during the study period was in the range of 8-120 per man per hour (PMH). From the study areas species B was identified from Jabalpur, Chindwara and Hoshangabad, Species C from Hoshangabad only, Species D from Narsinghpur and Khandwa and sibling species E from Mandla, Chindwara and Hoshangabad respectively.This is the first report to detect species E from Madhya Pradesh region which necessitate for reconsideration of species distribution of each An. culicifacies sibling species that would enable to develop required vector control strategies.

p441
aVThe present study was aimed at assessing alterations in serum PCT in terms of its relation to body weight gain in pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients undergoing treatment. Among patients (25-75 years) diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, those that were new smear positive, showed sputum conversion at the end of 2 months and were declared clinically cured at the end of 6 months, were included in the study (n = 40). Serum procalcitonin was determined by BRAHMS PCT-Q kit. Patients were divided into two study groups-Group 1 (n = 21; serum PCT > 2 ng/ml at diagnosis), Group 2 (n = 19; serum PCT > 10 ng/ml at diagnosis). Body weights of all patients were obtained at three different time points, PTB-0 (at diagnosis), PTB-2 (after 2 months of intensive treatment) and PTB-6 (after 6 months of treatment). In both groups, mean body weights at PTB-2 and PTB-6 were significantly higher than those at PTB-0 and at PTB-6 were significantly higher than those at PTB-2. However, percentage body weight gain following 2 months of intensive treatment was higher in group 1 (4.05 % gain, p < 0.01) than in group 2 (2.75 % body weight gain, p < 0.05). Thus, the percentage gain in group 1 was tending more towards the desirable minimum gain of 5 % during intensive phase. Increase in serum PCT levels in pulmonary tuberculosis is inversely associated with body weight gain during treatment. Thus, PCT could play a role in regulation of body weight gain in anorectic conditions like tuberculosis.

VVDR, RXR, Coronin-1 and Interferon\u03b3 Levels in PBMCs of Type-2 Diabetes Patients: Molecular Link between Diabetes and Tuberculosis.
p444
aVDiabetes and tuberculosis are world's most deadly epidemics. People suffering from diabetes are susceptible to tuberculosis. Molecular link between the two is largely unknown. It is known that Vitamin A receptor (RXR) heterodimerizes with Vitamin D receptor (VDR) and Peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) to regulate Tryptophan-aspartate containing coat protein (TACO) expression and fatty acid metabolism respectively, so it would be interesting to check the expression of these genes in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients which might explain the susceptibility of diabetics to tuberculosis. In this study, we checked the expression of RXR, VDR, TACO and Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) genes in type-2 DM patients for understanding the link between the two diseases. We observed down regulation of RXR gene and corresponding up regulation of TACO gene expression. We have not observed significant change in expression of VDR and IFN\u03b3 genes in type-2 DM patients. Repression of RXR gene could hamper VDR-RXR heterodimer formation and thus would up regulate TACO gene expression which may predispose the type-2 DM patients to tuberculosis. Also, decrease in RXR-PPAR\u03b3 heterodimer could be involved in DM.

aVTemporomandibular ankylosis is characterized by the formation of a bony mass which replaces normal temporomandibular joint (TMJ) articulation. Anaesthetic management in these patients requires expertise and dependable intubation technique that allows successful intubation due to anticipated difficulty in accessing the airway. A novel technique of endotracheal intubation is used for the successful airway management during the surgical treatment in patients with TMJ ankylosis with the assistance of fiberscope and GlideScope(®) videolaryngoscope. GlideScope(®) videolaryngoscope is a recently introduced system for tracheal intubation that has a dedicated video camera encased into a laryngoscope blade and provides better panoramic view than the conventional laryngoscopes. This technique avoids complications such as trauma to soft tissue structures surrounding the glottis during the passage of the tube over the fiberscope. It gives a clear view of the tube and its cuff position during intubation. It also abbreviates the time required for intubation which is a crucial determinant in this subset of patients owing to the difficult airway associated with paediatric age group.

Out of 142 patients, 108 fractures were found involving the M3 socket and 14.1 % had damage to M3.The presence of erupted mandibular third molar increases the chances of angle fracture when compared to impacted M3. Involvement of the M3 socket often resulted in increased operative time and complexity of the surgical procedure with possible removal of the damaged M3.

p453
aVThe surgical removal of impacted third molars involves, trauma to soft and bony tissue and can result in considerable pain, swelling, and trismus. The greater the amount of tissue injury the greater is the amount of inflammation in the perisurgical region. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is both a pro inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine. It is secreted by T cells and macrophages to stimulate the immune response. IL-6 is also an early marker of tissue damage. In addition to NSAIDs, corticosteroids, opioids also have immunomodulatory effects.To evaluate the changes in serum IL-6 levels following surgical removal of third molars under local anaesthesia after administration of two NSAIDs diclofenac and ketorolac and opioid tramadol post operatively.Patients undergoing surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molar teeth were randomly assigned to three groups. Each group received one of the three analgesics viz diclofenac 50 mg, ketorolac 10 mg and tramadol 50 mg. The mean levels of IL-6 was then estimated by ELISA.The results of our study showed that all three drugs i.e. diclofenac, ketorolac and tramadol have properties which can downregulate the production of IL-6 in response to surgical trauma.It is of clinical significance that the suppression of IL-6 values occurs in tramadol group closely following the diclofenac group. Even though the drug ketorolac suppresses the IL-6 levels similar to diclofenac initially but after 7 days tramadol and ketorolac showed similarities in suppression of IL-6 expression which is less compared to diclofenac group.

aVThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the antioxidant activity of flavoured milk enriched with antioxidative whey protein hydrolysates (WPHs) by radical scavenging method. Whey protein concentrate (WPC) was hydrolyzed by using three commercial proteases; flavouzyme, alcalase and corolase PP and these WPHs were analyzed for degree of hydrolysis and antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activities of these WPHs were evaluated using ABTS method. Trolox equivalent antioxidant activity of all the hydrolysates i.e. flavourzyme (0.81\u2009±\u20090.04), alcalase (1.16\u2009±\u20090.05) and corolase (1.42\u2009±\u20090.12) was higher than the WPC (0.19\u2009±\u20090.01). Among these, whey protein hydrolysates prepared using corolase showed maximum antioxidant activity. Total 15 \u03b2-lactoglobulin, 1 \u03b1-lactoalbumin, and 6 \u03b2-casein derived peptide fragments were identified in the WPHs by LC-MS/MS. Due to their size and characteristic amino acid composition, all the identified peptides may contribute for the antioxidant activity. The strawberry and chocolate flavoured milk was supplemented with WPC and WPHs and 2 % addition has shown increase in antioxidant activity upto 42 %. The result suggests that WPH could be used as natural biofunctional ingredients in enhancing antioxidant properties of food products.

As the popularity of the technique continues to grow, however, so does the population of patients with postsurgical persistent sinus disease, especially in those with a large window for ventilation and drainage. In addition, chronic infections of the sinuses especially fungal sinusitis have a higher incidence of recurrence even though a wide maxillary ostium had been performed earlier. This subset of patients often represents a challenge to the otorhinolaryngologist. Objectives\u2003To identify the patients with chronic recalcitrant maxillary sinusitis and devise treatment protocols for this subset of patients. Methods\u2003A retrospective review was done of all patients with persistent maxillary sinus disease who had undergone modified endoscopic medial maxillectomy between 2009 and 2012. We studied patient demographics, previous surgical history, and follow-up details and categorized the types of endoscopic medial maxillectomies performed in different disease situations. Results\u2003We performed modified endoscopic medial maxillectomies in 37 maxillary sinuses of 24 patients. The average age was 43.83 years. Average follow-up was 14.58 months. All patients had good disease control in postoperative visits with no clinical evidence of recurrences. Conclusion\u2003Modified endoscopic medial maxillectomy appears to be an effective surgery for treatment of chronic, recalcitrant maxillary sinusitis.

p481
aVCrizotinib, an orally active multi-targeted small-molecule anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor, is an effective treatment modality for advanced ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most drug-related adverse events are mild to moderate; however, some patients may develop acute interstitial lung disease (ILD) which is sometimes fatal. We present a case of crizotinib-associated ILD in a 47-year-old woman treated with crizotinib for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung. The patient presented with acute breathlessness and hypoxaemia in the second month of crizotinib therapy; radiological and histopathological work-up was suggestive of acute interstitial pneumonia. The patient improved clinically with corticosteroid therapy and was successfully re-challenged with crizotinib. In conclusion, while treating NSCLC patients with crizotinib, it is important to promptly investigate and treat any new-onset respiratory symptoms, as the latter could represent an adverse effect related to therapy. Prompt discontinuation of the offending drug and initiation of corticosteroid therapy may prevent adverse outcomes.

VMesopancreas in pancreatic cancer: where do we stand - review of literature.
p489
aVPancreatic cancer is associated with poor prognosis and surgery remains the main modality of treatment. Negative resection margin is an important prognostic factor for survival. Retropancreatic margin or the medial margin is the most common site of positive resection margin. Mesopancreas was proposed in analogy with mesorectum, which is considered as a fusion fascia formed embryologically during the development of pancreas. This mesopancreas lies posterior to the pancreas and contains pancreaticoduodenal vessels, lymphatics, nerve plexus and loose areolar tissue. Various technical modifications were proposed for better dissection of mesopancreas like posterior approach and artery first approach. There is an increased rate of R0 resection by these technical modifications but whether this will turn to increase in survival rates is yet to be established.

VEfficacy of leaves (drumstick, mint and curry leaves) powder as natural preservatives in restructured chicken block.
p492
aVThe use of natural preservatives to increase the shelf-life of meat products is promising as they possess antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Earlier, a highly acceptable restructured chicken slice without the addition of extra fat was developed in the same laboratory which was acceptable up to 10th day of storage under refrigeration and spoilage was mainly due to oxidation. Hence, the present study was planned to determine the efficacy of certain plant leaves' (drumstick, mint and curry leaves) powder at 1 % level as natural preservatives to enhance the shelf life of restructured chicken slices under refrigerated storage. The quality attributes of the products containing different natural preservativs were compared with the control and reference products. The control product contained no preservative and the reference product contained BHT (200 ppm) only. Incorporation of the leaf powders at 1 % level did not show any significant differences for both cooking yield (99.5-99.6 %) and proximate composition (moisture 72.2-72.3 %, protein 19.2-19.4 %, fat 4.2-4.3 % and total ash 2.3-2.4 %) of the restructured chicken slices compared to both control and reference products during storage. All products containing leaf powders showed significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.01) lower microbial counts (2.9-3.7 log10 CFU/g) compared to both control and BHT added products. Yeast and mould were not detected in any of the products throughout the storage period. Sensory evaluation scores showed that the restructured chicken slices incorporated with the leaf powders were as acceptable as the reference product and rated good to very good for appearance, flavor, juiciness and overall acceptability. Restructured chicken slices with the leaf powders could be safely stored without much loss in quality up to 20 days under refrigeration.

VRheology, fatty acid profile and quality characteristics of nutrient enriched pizza base.
p495
aVEnrichment of thick bread type pizza base (PZB) was done by substituting wheat flour (WF) with 5, 10 and 15 % soya protein isolate (SPI). The rheological characteristics of WF showed that water absorption increased, extensibility and peak viscosity decreased when level of SPI increased from 5 to 15 %. Baking studies showed that spread ratio decreased and hardness values of PZB increased with the increase in amount of SPI from 5 to15 %. Beyond 10 % SPI, the overall quality of PZB was adversely affected. To the optimal blend of 10 % SPI, 5 % psyllium husk (PH) was added and the hydrogenated fat was replaced by canola oil (CAN) in enriched PZB. The enriched PZB treated with combination of additives had 1.7 and 1.6 times more protein and dietary fiber than the control PZB. Fatty acid analysis showed that the enriched PZB had 58.65 % oleic, 6.58 % linolenic acid and 31.28 % polyunsaturated fatty acid and no Trans fat was present.

VEffect of different process parameters on the quality of soymilk and tofu from sprouted soybean.
p498
aVThe effect of grinding cum blanching (GCB) of sprouted soybean at different temperatures on milk and tofu quality was studied. Three temperatures (121 °C-T1,100 °C-T2 and 80 °C-T3) for GCB were used to produce soymilk and tofu from sprouted soybean which were analysed for the yield, nutritional, anti-nutritional profile, colour attributes, particle size, organoleptic quality and texture profile. Unsprouted Soybeans with GCB at 121 °C served as control (C). There was significant difference (P\u2009<\u20090.5) in trypsin inhibitor content in milk and ranged from 4.1 mg/g in T3 to 1.4 mg/g in T1. Optimal reduction in TI of 75-80 % was achieved in T2. There was significant difference (P\u2009<\u20090.5) in protein extractability and ranged from 84.4 % in C to 93.9 % in T2. Hardness (N) of tofu was around 11.22 in C and reduced to 8.9, 8.6 and 4.4 in T1, T2 and T3 respectively. L values of soymilk ranged from 83.4 in C to 85.8 in T3; in tofu from 83.1(T3) to 87.2 (C) and decreased with the increase in heating temperature and time. Particle size d [3, 2] and volume d [4, 3] between treatments varied significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.0001 and P\u2009<\u20090.0038). Overall acceptability scores on 9 point hedonic scale for all treatments for milk and tofu were above 5. The texture scores of tofu for T3 were very low due to its soft structure. From the above investigations 100 °C was the optimal temperature for GCB of sprouted soybean for the production of good quality soymilk and tofu.

aVJambhul and wood apple were subjected to two different drying methods to examine the effect of drying temperatures (80 °C and 60 °C) and influence of storage conditions viz., room temperature (25 °C) and refrigeration temperature (4 °C) on bioactive constituents of jambhul and wood apple powder for 90 days. Results showed that retention of phenolics, ascorbic acid and antioxidant capacity such as ABTS, DPPH and FRAP in jambhul and wood apple were high at 80 °C as compared to 60 °C in both tray and IR drying. Anthocyanin and flavonoid significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) decreased at 80 °C. Jambhul showed retention of 30.83 % TPC, 10.40 % TFC, 9.31 %, TMAC, 12.75 % ascorbic acid, 19.26 % ABTS activity, 98.71 % DPPH activity, and 27.78 % FRAP activitys in IR drying; whereas wood apple showed more retention of 25.74 % TPC, 61 % ascorbic acid, 10.31 % ABTS, 36.45 % DPPH and 0.27 % FRAP in tray drying (TD). During storage bioactive constituents in jambhul powder were preserved at refrigeration temperatures whereas in wood apple they were retained at room temperature.

VIsolated complete dislocation of the tarsal navicular without fracture: A rare injury.
p504
aVInjuries to the midtarsal joints usually occur in various combinations such as fracture, fracture subluxation, and fracture dislocation. Isolated dislocations of the navicular bone without fracture are rare injuries. The few existing case reports describe the probable mechanism of injury and optimal treatment. We present a 64-year-old diabetic man whose tarsal navicular was completely dislocated without fracture following a traffic accident. The most probable mechanism of injury was an abduction-pronation injury causing a midtarsal dislocation, and on spontaneous reduction, the navicular was dislocated medially. This mechanism is similar to perilunate dislocation. Computed tomography of the involved foot was done to accurately define the full extent of the bony injury and magnetic resonance imaging was required to determine if there was a ligamentous injury and to assess the attachment of soft tissues to the displaced bone to help assess the risk of avascular necrosis. The patient was treated successfully with open reduction and primary talonavicular arthrodesis with Kirschner wires.

VEffects of storage temperature on survival and infectivity of three indigenous entomopathogenic nematodes strains (Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae) from Meghalaya, India.
p508
aVThree locally isolated strains of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), viz. Heterorhabditis indica, Steinernema thermophilum and Steinernema glaseri, from Meghalaya, India were characterized in terms of storage temperature and survival and infectivity of their infective juveniles (IJs). The survival and infectivity of nematode IJs was studied at, 5 ± 2 and 25 ± 2 °C, for a period of 120 days, using deionized water as storage medium. The viability of nematode IJs was checked by mobility criterion at different storage periods, while the infectivity of nematode IJs was ascertained on the basis of establishment of IJs, using Galleria mellonella larva mortality tests in petridishes. The results of this study revealed that storage temperature markedly affects the survival as well as the establishment of nematode IJs of the three EPN species. At 5 °C, comparatively higher rate of IJ's survival (i.e. 74-86 %) was observed for 15 days of storage, but the same reduced drastically to 28-32 % after 30 days of storage for H. indica and S. thermophilum. On the other hand, at 25 °C, the survival of nematode IJs was observed till 120 days for all the three studied EPNs. In case of S. thermophilum and S. glaseri, higher rate of IJs survival (>75 %) was observed respectively at 15 and 30 days of observation. The study also showed that the establishment of IJs of the three EPN species declines with increase in storage periods, at both the test temperatures. In general, the nematodes stored at 25 °C showed comparatively better establishment than those stored at 5 °C. Among the three EPN studied, the establishment of S. glaseri was comparatively better than the rest of the species at both the temperatures and for different storage durations. In conclusion, our study adds further valuable information about the effect of storage temperature on survival and infectivity of three indigenous EPN species of Meghalaya, India which appears to be promising biocontrol agents of local insect pests.

aVTo report the outcomes of vitreous hemorrhage (VH) associated with hemorrhagic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV).A retrospective study of 28 eyes of 27 consecutive patients of hemorrhagic PCV with VH, which were managed surgically between January 2003 and December 2011, was performed. All patients underwent pars plana vitrectomy for VH associated with PCV. The main outcome measure was best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at baseline, at 1, 3 and 6 months post operatively and at last follow up.The visual acuity measured on early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) chart improved in 16 eyes (57.1 %) by two or more lines, remained unchanged in nine eyes (32.1 %) and decreased in three (10.7 %) after surgery when compared to baseline VA. The mean baseline VA was 2.69 ± 0.57 logMAR units (<20/2000) which improved to 1.65 ± 0.93 logMAR units (20/800) at 1 month post operative visit and was sustained at 1.72 ± 1.12 (20/800) with an improvement of 0.96 logMAR units (p < 0.001, 95 % CI 0.54-1.37). The average postoperative follow up was for 14.2 months (range 1-84). The complications noted in postoperative follow up were cataract (n = 10), macular scaring (n = 9), organised dehemoglobinised blood (n = 7), retinal tear or detachment (n = 5), recurrent VH (n = 3) and choroidal detachment (n = 1).Majority of patients with loss of vision due to VH secondary to hemorrhagic PCV have sustained improvement in visual acuity following surgery.

p516
aVOdontogenic fascial space infections are commonly encountered by the oral and maxillofacial surgeon. A retrospective study of the epidemiological characteristics, microbiological analysis and treatment response to odontogenic infections treated in the oral and maxillofacial unit of a Dental school is presented. A retrospective analysis of case records of all odontogenic infections that reported to the oral and maxillofacial surgery unit in a Dental school over a period of 2 years was performed. Epidemiological data, microbiological profile and treatment responses were analysed. All data were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS statistical package. Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test and nonparametric tests were carried out. A total of 2,140 patients were included in this study. Mandibular third molars were the offending tooth in nearly 40 % of cases with 107 patients becoming symptomatic following a dental extraction procedure. All patients were treated with surgical incision and drainage, antibiotics and local wound care. More than 95 % cases needed intraoral incisions. Penicillin was the drug in most of the cases. The pterygomandibular space was the most commonly involved with 15 % reporting with multiple fascial space involvement. Microbiological analysis showed a predominance of aerobic gram positive organisms with Streptococcus sanguis most commonly isolated. Peptostreptococci and Propionibacterium were the common anaerobes isolated. More than 80 % of the strains isolated were sensitive to penicillin. The average length of stay was 6.3 days. Inadequate documentation with regards to referral patterns, antibiotic history was commonly observed in case records. Penicillin continues to remain the drug of choice for a vast majority of maxillofacial infections of odontogenic origin. A delay in reporting can lead to worsening of symptoms with consequent increase in surgical morbidity and costs of treatment. Preventive dental care remains the best option available to mitigate the consequences of poor oral hygiene. Poor awareness among patient population for regular dental reviews and oral hygiene maintenance emphasises the need for sensitisation and education programs.

VEvaluation of the Flinders Technology Associates Cards for Storage and Temperature Challenges in Field Conditions for Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Surveillance.
p519
aVFoot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) samples transported to the laboratory from far and inaccessible areas for diagnosis and identification of FMDV pose a major problem in a tropical country like India, where wide fluctuation of temperature over a large geographical area is common. Inadequate storage methods lead to spoilage of FMDV samples collected from clinically positive animals in the field. Such samples are declared as non-typeable by the typing laboratories with the consequent loss of valuable epidemiological data. In this study, an attempt was made to evaluate the robustness of Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) cards for storage and transportation of FMDV samples in different climatic conditions which will be useful for FMDV surveillance. Simulation transport studies were conducted using FTA impregnated FMDV samples during post-monsoon (September-October 2010) and summer season (May-June 2012). FMDV genome or serotype could be identified from the FTA cards after the simulation transport studies with varying temperature (22-45°C) and relative humidity (20-100%). The stability of the viral RNA, the absence of infectivity and ease of processing the sample for molecular methods make the FTA cards an useful option for transport of FMDV genome for identification and type determination. The method can be used routinely for FMDV research as it is economical and the cards can be transported easily in envelopes by regular courier/postal systems. The absence of live virus in FTA card can be viewed as an advantage as it restricts the risk of transmission of live virus.

VPrevalence of aspirin resistance in Asian-Indian patients with stable coronary artery disease.
p523
aVTo evaluate the prevalence of pharmacological resistance to aspirin therapy by measuring platelet functions using the technique of light transmission aggregometry.Aspirin is the cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, a substantial proportion of patients manifest breakthrough thrombotic events despite regular intake of aspirin suggesting therapeutic resistance to aspirin.We prospectively studied 126 patients with stable coronary artery disease at a tertiary center, who were recruited after ensuring compliance with a single formulation of aspirin (enteric coated aspirin 150 mg). Platelet aggregation was measured using light transmission aggregometry with ADP (10 µM) and Arachidonic acid (0.5 mg/mL). Pharmacological aspirin resistance was defined as the combined demonstration of mean platelet aggregation of \u226570% with 10 µM ADP and a mean aggregation of \u226520% with 0.5 mg/mL A.A. Patients satisfying either one of the above criteria were defined as semi-responders. Patients satisfying neither criterion were defined as "aspirin responders".Out of 126 patients with stable CAD, 64 % were responders, 36% were non responders (semi-responders\u2009=\u200934% and resistant\u2009=\u20092%). Of the laboratory parameters, only the total leukocyte count was significantly associated with the presence of aspirin resistance (P\u2009<\u20090.03).Pharmacological resistance to aspirin is noted in 36% (semi-responders\u2009=\u200934% and resistant\u2009=\u20092%) of Asian Indian patients with stable CAD. Long-term follow up of these patients will assist in determining the clinical importance of this phenomenon. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

aVOsteoporosis (OP) is the most common metabolic bone disease predominantly found in elderly people. It is associated with reduced bone mineral density, results in a higher probability of fractures, especially of the hip, vertebrae, and distal radius. Worldwide prevalence of OP is considered a serious public health concern.The purpose of the present work was to develop and evaluate polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) of risedronate sodium (RIS) for the treatment of OP using intranasal (IN) route in order to reduce peripheral toxic effects.Polymeric NPs of RIS were prepared by nanoprecipitation methods. Formulations were developed and evaluated in context to in vitro drug release, ex vivo permeation, in vivo study, and biochemical studies.The particles size, entrapment efficiency (EE) (%), and loading capacity (LC) (%) of optimized formulations were found to be 127.84\u2009±\u20096.33\u2009nm, 52.65\u2009±\u20095.21, and 10.57\u2009±\u20091.48, respectively. Release kinetics showed diffusion-controlled, Fickian release pattern. Ex vivo permeation study showed RIS from PLGA-NPs permeated significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) through nasal mucosa. In vivo study showed a marked difference in micro-structure (trabeculae) in bone internal environment. Biochemical estimation of treated group and RIS PLGA indicated a significant recovery (p\u2009<\u20090.01) as compared with the toxic group.Polymeric NPs of RIS were prepared successfully using biodegradable polymer (PLGA). Intranasal delivery showed a good result in in vivo study. Thus PLGA-NPs have great potential for delivering the RIS for the treatment and prevention of OP after clinical evaluation in near future.

VPreparation and evaluation of nanoparticles loaded ophthalmic in situ gel.
p531
aVConventional ophthalmic solutions often eliminate rapidly after administration and cannot provide and maintain an adequate concentration of drug in the pre-corneal area.Above problem can be overcome by the use of in situ gel forming systems that are instilled as drops in to the eye and undergo a sol-gel transition in the cul-de-sac.An ion sensitive polymer gellan gum was used as gelling agent which formed immediate gel and remained for extended time period. Nanoparticles of moxifloxacin, prepared by solvent evaporation, were separated by freeze drying. The rheological properties and in vitro drug release test of in situ gel loaded with nanoparticles were evaluated and compared with marketed preparation. In vitro release study demonstrated diffusion controlled release for moxifloxacin from formulations over a period of 12\u2009h.The developed formulation was stable and showed enhanced contact time minimizing the frequency of administration. Confocal microscopy showed clear permeation of drug loaded nanoparticles across L/S of cornea.The formulation of moxifloxacin was found liquid at the formulated pH and formed gel in the presence of mono or divalent cations. The gel formed in situ showed sustained drug release over a period of 10-12\u2009h. The formulations were less viscous before instillation and formed strong gel after instilling it into cul-de-sac. It is thus concluded that by adopting a systematic formulation approach, an optimum point can be reached in the shortest time with minimum efforts to achieve desirable rheological and in vitro release property for in situ gel forming system.

VBiology of Trypanosoma (Trypanozoon) evansi in experimental heterologous mammalian hosts.
p534
aVTrypanosoma (Trypanozoon) evansi is a causative agent of the dreadful mammalian disease trypanosomiasis or 'Surra' and carried as a latent parasite in domestic cattle but occasionally proves fatal when transmitted to horses and camel. Sporadic outbreak of 'Surra' to different animals (beside their natural hosts) reminds that T. evansi may be zoonotic, as their close relative cause sleeping sickness to human being. This haemoflagellate is mechanically transmitted by horse fly and its effect on different host varies depending on certain factors including the effectiveness of transmission by mechanical vector, the suitability and susceptibility of the host as well as most importantly the ability of the disease establishment of parasite to adapt itself to the host's resistance, etc. The course of the disease caused by T. evansi is similar to that of human sleeping sickness caused by T. (T.) brucei gambiense. The target organs and symptoms show close similarity. T. evansi can successfully be transmitted among unnatural hosts i.e., other classes of vertebrates, like chicken. In transmission experiments, the unnatural hosts may sometimes induce profound changes in the biology of trypanosomes. Hence, in present study the observations are the biology of different morphological changes of T. evansi as well as its ability of disease formation within some heterologous mammal viz., albino rat, guineapig, bandicoot, mongoose, domestic cat and common monkey. Blood smears of infected albino rats, bandicoot, and mongoose revealed only monomorphic form. Interestingly, blood smears of infected cat and monkey, T. evansi shows slender trypomastigote form and short intermediate form whereas organ smears shows other two forms of haemoflagellate viz., sphaeromastigote and amastigote form. The haemoflagellate maintains a common reproductive cycle in all the experimental heterologous hosts whereas disease symptoms differ. T. evansi infected cat and monkey shows nervous symptoms. Infected monkey expresses some symptoms similar to that of human sleeping sickness disease. Thus the paper highlights zoonotic potentialities of T. evansi.

VSolitary Extramedullary Plasmacytoma of the Maxillary Sinus, Progressing to Smoldering Multiple Myeloma with Multifocal Skeletal Involvement, which Resolved Completely Following Chemotherapy Alone.
p537
aVPlasmacytoma is an uncommon malignant tumor originating either from plasma cells located in the bone marrow also known as the solitary bone plasmacytoma, or from plasma cells located outside the bone, for e.g. in mucosal surfaces, referred to as the extramedullary plasmacytoma also called the solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma. Both, solitary as well as extramedullary bone plasmacytomas may, particularly in later stages, be accompanied by other osteolytic bone lesions (multifocal bone involvement) and features such as anemia, hypercalcemia, or renal impairment attributable to and indicative of progression to multiple myeloma. These three distinct disorders together comprise the plasma cell neoplasms and essentially represent a continuum of related disease processes. Extramedullary and solitary bone plasmacytomas of the head and neck region are extremely uncommon, and amongst them plasmacytoma of the maxilla is extremely rare. Such a case is being reported here for its rarity. Also, it was associated with multifocal skeletal involvement, making a correct categorization difficult as well as imperative in order to institute the correct treatment. Radiotherapy is considered to be the treatment of choice of plasmacytoma, with adjuvant chemotherapy for multi focal involvement. Surgery is usually limited to biopsy and excision of any residual disease following radiotherapy. The case presented responded extremely well to chemotherapy alone, with a complete resolution of the maxillary tumor, obviating the need for radiotherapy.

Along with normal appearing neutrophils there were many neutrophils with bilobed and single monolobated nuclei which accounted for 82 % of the neutrophils. After identifying these neutrophilic abnormalities which were suggestive of Pelgeroid changes, the other family members were also screened and were found to be having similar morphologic abnormalities in granulocytes. As these changes were evident in granulocytic leucocytes of the patient as well as her mother, both her sisters and her son, with exception of her brother, the diagnosis of familial Pelger-Huet Anomaly was considered in this case.

The audit group comprised 65 pregnancies (67 babies), of whom 27 had preexisting diabetes and 38 cases developed gestational diabetes. Pregnant women who were found to be diabetic preconceptionally or in the first trimester were classified as 'pre-existing diabetes'.There were total of 65 diabetic women in this retrospective study, 39 women were GDM (60 %) while 26 women (40 %) were having pre-existing diabetes (24 type 1 diabetes and 2 women were in type 2 diabetes group). There were 35 multigravid women (53.85 %) and 30 primigravid women (46.15 %). There were 39 (60 %) women on Insulin. There were 42 Lower Segment Caesarean Section (64.62 %) and 23 Spontaneous Vaginal Delivery (35.38 %). In fetal and neonatal complications, there were three still births, one case of intrapartum death, and one case of shoulder dystocia. Fetal anomalies were less frequent, one case of Gastroschisis with Hydrocephalus associated with Menigomyelocoele, there was one case of isolated Hydrocephalus, and there was also one case of Truncus arteriosus.The study analyses maternal and fetal complication in the GDM group and also preexisting diabetes group. In our centre, the 60 % women were GDM while 40 % were having pre-existing diabetes. Total rate of fetal/neonatal complication rate was 7.69 % and of congenital anomaly rate it was 9.23 %. Proportion of still birth, Intrauterine death, and congenital malformations was higher in the pre-existing diabetes group although the data are not large enough to draw a statistically significant conclusion. LSCS rate was little higher in the GDM group (69.23 %) in comparison to the preexisting diabetes group where it was 57.69 %. SVD (Spontaneous Vaginal Delivery) rate was 30.77 % in GDM and 42.31 % in the pre-existing diabetes group. HbA1c was within normal range 84.62 % of GDM group while in 15.38 % it was raised >6 %. In the pre-existing diabetes group, only 19.23 % of women had HbA1c within acceptable range and 80.77 % had it >6. The aim of St Vincent Declaration is to 'achieve pregnancy outcome in the diabetic woman that is similar to that of the non-diabetic woman.' But, so far we have not been able to achieve this. Our HbA1c level is remarkably high in the pre-existing diabetes group. Only 3 out of 65 patients' women took Folic Acid periconceptionally. We need to work to achieve it our best. It is well known that insulin treatment during pregnancy results in reduction in the rate of macrosomia, fetal/neonatal, and maternal complications. Therefore, we need to use insulin judiciously and advocate its usage in the situations where it is needed.

VAlteration of Lipid Profile in Patients with Head and Neck Malignancy.
p562
aVLipids are the major cell membrane components, essential for various biological functions including cell growth and division for the maintenance of cell integrity of normal and malignant tissues. The changes in lipid profile have been associated since long with cancer and hypocholesterolemia has been observed in patients with cancers of various organs. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the alterations and clinical significance of plasma lipid profiles in untreated head and neck malignancies. The present case-control study comprises of newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed, 100 head and neck malignancy cases diagnosed between 1st July 2013 and 30th June 2014 in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal. Fasting blood samples were collected and the lipid profile studied. In present study, the authors found that there is a preponderance of head and neck malignancy in the age group of 41-60 years, males having the higher incidence. Malignancy involving oral cavity were the commonest and majority were well differentiated. Statistically, there was a highly significant reduction of mean serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides and high density lipoproteins (HDL) in the subjects of head and neck malignancy as compared to the control group. TC and HDL were also found significantly lower among those with habit of tobacco consumption.

VGenitourinary Fistula: An Indian Perspective.
p565
aVIn developing countries, obstetric trauma is the most common cause of genitourinary fistulae. But over the last two decades, health care facilities have been improved and the scenario has been changed.The aim of the present study is to share our experience with genitourinary fistula in terms of mode of presentation, diagnostic modality, and management with the emphasis on the surgical approach and a parallel review of the available literature.During a 6-year period from January 2007 to December 2013, 41 cases of genitourinary fistula, who admitted and treated in the urology department of a tertiary care center, were retrospectively analyzed for etiology, site, size and number of fistulae, clinical presentation, diagnostic modalities, and management. The literature search was done using the Medline database.Mean age of the patient was 27 years (range 16-51). Primary and simple fistulae were common. Obstetric trauma was the most common etiology (56.09 %) followed by iatrogenic (39.03 %). Vesicovaginal fistula was the most common type (78.37 %) and trigone was the most common site involved (51.72 %). 51.35 % of patients were approached successfully by the vaginal route. Ancillary procedures were required in patients for various other associated anomalies at the time of fistula repair. The success rate on follow up was 94.5 %. In the mean follow up of 3 years, 35 patients were sexually active.Genitourinary fistula is a frustrating entity with potentially devastating psychosocial consequence. Its management poses a tricky challenge to the surgeon. Accurate and timely diagnosis, adhering on basic surgical principle, and repair by an experienced surgeon provide the optimum chance of cure.

VShining Pearls Sign: A New Identity for Venous Malformations on Computed Tomographic Imaging.
p575
aVVascular malformations, in particular venous malformations (VM), are common lesions involving the pediatric and adolescent population. VM occur at approximately 1:5,000 to 10,000; approximately 40% of them occur in the head and neck regions. Classical appearance of VM on imaging is a demonstration of near-normal-sized or mildly dilated feeding arteries which subsequently lead to dilated venous structures of varying caliber, thus constituting the malformation. Phleboliths are the hallmark of VM. Plain radiography has been an established modality for demonstrating phleboliths. The emergence of computed tomographic (CT) as a preferred imaging modality for the evaluation of a complex vascular malformation necessitates familiarity with the spectrum of CT appearances of this lesion. This presentation illustrates an additional CT sign, "shining pearls sign," highlighting the striking display of phleboliths in the vascular malformations, prompting correct diagnosis.

This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of raised BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar among serving armed forces personnel \u226535 yrs of age.The study was carried out between Jan 2013-Jun 2013. The study included all individuals \u226535 yrs of age deployed/posted in specific districts of northern part of the country (N = 5143) instead of a limited sample size.In this study, obesity was observed in 3.42% (95% CI: 2.96%-3.95%), raised BP in 14.07% (95% CI: 13.15%-15.05%) and raised blood sugar levels in 1.71% (95% CI: 1.39%-2.10%). Additionally, 67.72% (95% CI: 66.43%-68.99%) were pre-obese and 82.65% (95% CI: 81.60%-83.67%) were pre-hypertensives.Lower prevalence of hypertension, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia was observed in armed forces personnel in comparison to country specific data. However, high prevalence of pre-obese and pre-hypertension suggests a need for concerted efforts towards preventive activities in this field.

VNovel tablet formulation of amorphous candesartan cilexetil solid dispersions involving P-gp inhibition for optimal drug delivery: in vitro and in vivo evaluation.
p581
aVThe aim of this study was to develop a novel tablet formulation of amorphous candesartan cilexetil (CAN) solid dispersion involving effective P-gp inhibition for optimal drug delivery by direct compression (DC) method.To accomplish DC, formulation blends were evaluated for micromeritic properties. The Carr index, Hausner ratio, flow rate and cotangent of the angle \u03b1 were determined. The tablets with and without naringin prepared by DC technique were evaluated for average weight, hardness, disintegration time and friability assessments. The drug release profiles were determined to study the dissolution kinetics. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in rabbits. Accelerated stability studies were performed for tablets at 40\u2009±\u20092\u2009°C/75% RH\u2009±\u20095% for 6 months.FTIR studies confirmed no discoloration, liquefaction and physical interaction between naringin and drug. The results indicated that tablets prepared from naringin presented a dramatic release (82%) in 30\u2009min with a similarity factor (76.18), which is most likely due to the amorphous nature of drug and the higher micromeritic properties of blends. Our findings noticed 1.7-fold increase in oral bioavailability of tablet prepared from naringin with mean Cmax and AUC0-12\u2009h values as 35.81\u2009±\u20090.13\u2009\u03bcg/mL and 0.14\u2009±\u20090.09\u2009\u03bcg h/mL, respectively. The tablets with and without naringin prepared by DC technique were physically and chemically stable under accelerated stability conditions upon storage for 6 months.These results are attractive for further development of an oral tablet formulation of CAN through P-gp inhibition using naringin, a natural flavonoid as a pharmaceutical excipient.

aVHighly popular and delicious fish of Kerala (India), pearlspot, Etroplus suratensis is known for its ability to tolerate wide range of salinity, omnivorous feeding behavior. Present report documents the occurrence and management of Caligus rotundigenitalis in brackishwater pond meant for culture demonstration of pearlspot in Gujarat, (India). A brackishwater aquaculture pond (1,500 sq m) was stocked with pearlspot fry (2.60 ± 0.83 g; 4.31 ± 0.82 cm) @ 25,000 ha(-1). On the 46th day of culture couple of dead fish were observed which gradually increased to 120 per day by 52nd day. Following the close observation parasitic infestation was noticed on gills cavities ranging from 15 to 20 numbers per fish. These characteristic features confirmed the parasite as C. rotundigenitalis. As a therapeutic measure the infested pond was successfully treated with Butox(®) @ 300 ml/ha (Deltamethrin 12.5 mg) and repeat dose was administered 2 weeks later. The results of the study suggest the possible therapeutic value of Deltamethrin in treatment of caligid infestation in pond cultured pearlspot.

aVThe present study deals with the investigation of different degrees of genetic resistance/resilience of Uttarakhand hill goats to natural infection with gastrointestinal nematodes in order to introduce into breeding schemes. Animals were naturally infected with Haemonchus contortus, Teladorsagia circumcincta, Oesophagostomum spp. and Trichostrongylus spp. Faecal egg counts (FEC) were carried out every month for a period of 1 year and blood samples were collected every third month for the determination of indicator traits such as FEC, packed cell volume (PCV) and haemoglobin (Hb). The mean egg per gram (EPG), PCV and Hb were 1,579.6 ± 346, 35.12 ± 1.1 and 8.7 ± 0.2, respectively. The goats were divided into three groups (<800, 801-2,000 and >2,000) based on EPG. The EPG showed a negative correlation with both Hb and PCV (P < 0.01). Therefore, it was concluded that the Hb and PCV value would decrease, if EPG increases.

aVHaemonchus contortus infection is the major hurdle in growth and productivity in small ruminants especially in tropical countries. Indiscriminate and long term use of currently available chemotherapeutic agents lead to development of resistance in microorganisms and residual problems in population. Therefore, present study was undertaken to evaluate the anthelmintic efficacy of aqueous extract of Zanthoxylum armatum DC. seeds against adult H. contortus worms of small ruminants. Proximate analysis of seed powder shows high crude protein, Cu, Zn and Ca concentration. Phytochemical ingredients of extract revealed high total phenolic, flavonoids and tannin contents. In vitro experimental trial revealed complete mortality of H. contortus worms at the concentration of 100 mg/ml at the time exposure of 8 h. At 50 mg/ml concentration the mortality at 6 and 8 h were 45.45 ± 4.55 and 63.64 ± 4.54 %. Median lethal concentration (LC50) at 6 and 8 h were 59.90 and 28.92 mg/ml, respectively. Levamisole at concentration of 0.5 mg/ml caused 50 % mortality at 2 h post exposure and 100 % mortality at 4 h post exposure. The results confirm the cidal effect of the aqueous extract of Z. armatum DC. seeds on adult H. contortus worms.

aVDespite presence of anticoccidial drugs and vaccines in the market, coccidiosis continues to result in substantial economic losses to the poultry industry. There is wide-spread resistance to already known anticoccidial drugs. It is an infectious disease of poultry and rigorous management is required during vaccination. In addition there is possibility of drug residues in meat and other byproducts of such treated animals and consequently makes more imperative to explore and understand the role of natural products in livestock parasite management. Therefore a study was designed to evaluate the anticoccidial activity of aqueous extract of Ganoderma applanatum in broiler chicken. In-vivo anticoccidial activity of aqueous extract of G. applanatum was measured in comparison to the reference drug amprolium on the basis of oocysts per gram of faeces, weight gain and feed conversion ratio. Oocyst output was measured with the help of Mc-Masters counting technique. The results of this study established the virulence of coccidian oocysts and the effectiveness of both amprolium and aqueous extract of G. applanatum against coccidian oocysts, confirmed by the fact that treatment with aqueous extract of G. applanatum resulted in a noticeable reduction in coccidian oocysts output, leading to improved weight gain and better feed conversion ratio. The study highlighted the potential of G. applanatum as a natural source of bioactive components for controlling a protozoan parasite, which can be isolated and tested in a bioassay-guided manner and harnessed in the form of anticoccidial drugs.

Serum samples from 175 immunodeficient and 175 immunocompetent patients were collected and were analyzed by in-house enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A questionnaire survey was administered for all study participants to gather information on risk factors. The present study revealed that anti- T. gondii IgG antibodies were detected in 13.14 % which constitutes 15.43 % in immunocompromised and 10.86 % in immunocompetent patients. There was a significant difference between sex of the study population and drinking water source. Seroprevalence was increased in the male (19.12 %, p = 0.0075, OR 2.316, 95 % CI 1.2362-4.3405) than the female and with river water consumption other than bore water (12.5 %, p = 0.0483, OR 0.857, 95 % CI 0.1853-3.4641). No significant relations were observed between anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibodies and age, residence, diet and animal contact in the study population. Toxoplasmosis will remain a problem, mainly in risk groups such as pregnant women and immunocompromised patients. Improvement can only be attained by increasing prevention and reducing the risk factors.

Threads are attached to the vertical limb so that the user can find out the location of the device. Sometimes the threads are not palpable by the user; this study was conducted to find out the reasons for inability to palpate the threads.The retrospective study was conducted over a period of eight years; 110 female patients who complained of inability to feel the threads were included in the study. In most of the cases the device was in the right place. In four cases the device could not be felt on uterine sounding; this could have been due to subendometrial placement of the device. There was no case of perforation by the device.Inability to feel the threads is a common complaint by the patients who are using intrauterine contraceptive device. In most of the cases the device was in correct position and could be localized by clinical examination. Ultrasonography can help in localization of the device; if used at the time of insertion it can confirm proper insertion and location of the device. This will reassure the client and the health care providers.

VImpact of Structured Counseling on Choice of Contraceptive Method Among Postpartum Women.
p646
aVIn India, although a number of contraceptive choices are available, the usage of contraceptive methods among postpartum women is rather low. The current study intended to determine the impact of "structured contraception counseling" on women's decision making on selection of contraceptive methods and the reasons behind the selection of a contraceptive method.One-hundred-and-seventeen postpartum women in the age group of 18-35 years, requesting contraception, were enrolled in the study. "Structured contraception counseling" was provided using a standardized protocol with balanced and comprehensive education material on the available hormonal and nonhormonal contraceptive methods. Questionnaires with information on the women's pre- and post-counseling contraceptive choice, her perceptions, and the reasons behind her postcounseling decision were filled by the participating women.Maximum women enrolled for the study were in the age group of 21-25 years. In pre-counseling, 36 % postpartum women selected a contraceptive method, 23.1 % a nonhormonal method, and 12.8 % a hormonal method. After "structured contraception counseling," 92.25 % of women chose a contraceptive method. There were significant differences between the women's choices of contraceptive methods in the pre- and post-counseling sessions, respectively [progesterone-only pills (POP): 5.1 vs. 38.46 %, (p < 0.001); injectable-depot medroxy progesterone acetate (DMPA): 2.56 vs. 21.356 %, (p < 0.01); and intra uterine device (IUD): 10.28 vs. 23.92 %, (p < 0.001). 38.46 % chose a POP, 21.36 % injectable-DMPA, and 23.9 % the IUD]."Structured contraception counseling" using standardized protocol resulted in significant improvements in the selection of contraceptive methods by postpartum women.

VMetabolic Syndrome: Can We Keep Check?
p649
aVMetabolic syndrome (MetS) is on the rise due to the epidemic increase of obesity. It increases the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases and type II diabetes mellitus.To study the prevalence of MetS and its components in premenopausal and postmenopausal women.Cross-sectional comparative study.Five hundred premenopausal women and 500 postmenopausal women in the age group 40-65 years, attending OPD of Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Pt. J.N.M. Medical College, Raipur from September 2012 to August 2014 were analyzed and assessed for the MetS risk factors and evaluated according to the NCEP ATP III criteria.The prevalence of MetS in postmenopausal women was 48.6 %, nearly 1.7 times the prevalence in premenopausal women (27.4 %). Except for central obesity and low HDL cholesterol, the frequency of hyperglycemia, high blood pressure, and hypertriglyceridemia were significantly higher in postmenopausal than in premenopausal women. All the five factors of NCEP ATP III criteria were present in 5 % of postmenopausal women in contrast to 0.4 % in premenopausal women.Prevention is better than cure. The need of the hour is to target premenopausal women who are at risk of developing MetS in their postmenopausal age. It will delay and prevent them from future morbidities.

VOvarian Fibroma: A Clinico-pathological Study of 23 Cases with Review of Literature.
p653
aVThe purpose of this study was to correlate the clinical findings, RMI-4 index and frozen section, in cases of ovarian fibroma with the final histopathology.This is a retrospective study of clinical and pathological features of 23 patients of ovarian fibroma. The patient's age ranged from 34 to 66 years (mean-49 years). The most common presenting symptom was abdominal pain. On clinical examination, the mean size of ovarian tumor was 9.5 cm, CA-125 levels were found to be raised in 14 patients, and it was associated with ascites in 10 patients. USG showed a well-circumscribed mass (with a mean size of 14 cm), on the left side in 14 cases and on the right side in 9 patients. RMI-4 was calculated in all the patients, and it revealed the possibility of a benign histology in 17 patients. All patients underwent exploratory laparotomy with the removal of ovarian tumor followed by frozen section examination. All but one (22/23) patient had positive correlation among frozen section and final histopathological findings.Ovarian fibroma generally tends to occur in post-menopausal women. All the patients in our study of ovarian fibroma were symptomatic, with the presence of palpable mass in majority of patients. RMI-4 Index correlated very well with benign nature of disease. Frozen section has an invaluable role at surgery; fertility-conserving surgery is the choice in young women.Clinical findings, RMI-4 Index and frozen section, play vital roles before and during surgery in cases of benign ovarian tumors.

VObesity or Underweight-What is Worse in Pregnancy?
p656
aVThis study was conducted to compare underweight and obese women and their weight gain during pregnancy on fetomaternal outcome.This is a prospective, non-interventional, observational study on 1000 women (BMI between 20 and 30 were excluded). Women attending ANC OPD with singleton pregnancy at or before 16 weeks were included and BMI calculated in early pregnancy. Their weight gain during pregnancy was noted. Any complications in the mother or perinate were noted.Incidence of obesity in our institute was 17 % and that of underweight was 18 %. Pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertensions, gestational DM, antepartum hemorrhage, all were more common among obese women, while anemia was more common in the underweight. Post-dated pregnancy, induction of labor, cesarean delivery, and postpartum complications were more common in obese women. Fetal complications were also higher in obese patients.Lower as well as higher prepregnancy BMI is an independent risk factor that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in both the mother and the fetus.

VPerinatal Outcome of the Second Twin at a Tertiary Care Center in India.
p659
aVThis cross-sectional observational study was undertaken to assess perinatal outcome of the second twin in respect to gestational age, presentation, mode of delivery, and birth weight.Seventy women with confirmed twin pregnancy were admitted and managed in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Kolkata, India from May 2008 to April 2009. All relevant data were recorded and analyzed statistically by simple proportions and \u03c7(2) test.Women with frequent antenatal visits had highly favorable perinatal outcome than those with fewer or no visits in this hospital (p < 0.001). Higher perinatal mortality was observed among preterm than term (p < 0.01) cases, and among low birth weight than normal babies (p < 0.05). Second twins in vertex-vertex presentation encountered higher perinatal mortality compared to those in vertex-nonvertex and nonvertex-other presentations (p < 0.05). Perinatal outcome was unfavorable when both delivered vaginally than for both cesarean deliveries and cesarean after first vaginal delivery (p < 0.01). Preterm labor was the most frequently observed maternal complication. Birth asphyxia and perinatal mortality were common among second than first twins.Gestational age, presentation, mode of delivery, and birth weight are the significant determinants of perinatal outcome of the second twin. Women with frequent antenatal care show favorable outcome. The second twin is at higher risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality than the first twin.

aVTo study the role of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in perinatal outcome.A randomized, case control study was conducted at Safdarjang hospital, New Delhi. Patients were recruited from Sept. 2011 to May 2013 and were followed up till delivery. Thirty cases and controls were enrolled which comprised non-thrombophilic patients with previous history of preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, abruption, and stillbirth (>20 weeks). Study group received daily single dose of LMWH depending upon the weight, subcutaneously; it was started before 15 weeks of gestation and continued up to 36 weeks. Nursery/NICU admission, APGAR score at 0 and 5 min, birth weight, gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery were observed among the interventional and control groups.There was substantial reduction (80 %) in nursery/NICU admission. The mean gestational age and birth weight of the cases were observed to be higher as compared to those of control (38.05 ± 2.02 vs. 37.58 ± 2.06 weeks and 2770 ± 400 vs. 2530 ± 0.533 g).Prophylactic LMWH before 15 weeks of gestation improved the perinatal outcome in non-thrombophilic pregnant women.

VUsing Sonographically Estimated Myometrial Thickness in Prediction of Latency Interval in Cases of Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes (PPROM).
p665
aVTo study myometrial thickness (MT) sonographically as a predictor of latency interval in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM).The data were collected in a prospective manner from the antenatal patients between November 2011 and June 2013 during the follow-up of patients in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Goa Medical College. 100 patients with the periods of gestation of 28-36 weeks were studied, out of which 50 were PPROM cases and 50 were controls, both not in labor. The demographic factors and MT of uterine wall are measured at four different levels: midanterior, posterior, lower uterine segment (LUS), and fundus, which are then compared with the latency interval which is defined as the time from the rupture of membranes to the time of delivery.There was a significant inverse relation between the periods of gestation and latency interval, and positive correlation between anterior MT (p value 0.047), LUS thickness (p value 0.000), and latency interval implicating that the thicker the myometrium at admission in cases of PPROM the longer the latency period.MT appears a promising tool for obstetricians for predicting latency in cases of PPROM and guiding the management.

VAetiological Classification of Stillbirths: A Case Control Study.
p671
aVAntepartum stillbirths are a major contributor to perinatal mortality. This study was undertaken to assess the role of the ReCoDe (relevant condition at birth) classification system in evaluation of stillbirths in a tertiary teaching hospital in Central Gujarat.To determine etiology of stillbirths using the ReCoDe classification system.This was a prospective case control study over a period of 1 year from September 1st, 2012 to August 31st, 2013. Sample size was calculated as 243 cases and 486 controls. Two controls (live births) per case were matched for gestational age and birth weight. Odd's ratios with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated using multivariate logistic regression.Maternal age and parity that appeared to be highly significant factors on univariate analysis were not found to be independent risk factors with multivariate logistic regression. Gestational age and birth weight were not statistically significant risk factors. Other risk factors like previous stillbirth (26.13; 95 % CI 3.23-211.29), antepartum hemorrhage (11.63; 95 % CI 3.83-35.30), and hypertensive disorders (2.09; 95 % CI 1.20-3.63) were found to be highly significant independent risk factors. Major congenital anomaly (P < 0.001), birth asphyxia (P = 0.0037), cord accidents (P = 0.0037), and rupture uterus (P = 0.001) were also highly significant.The stillbirth rate was 87.83 per 1000 live births. The ReCoDe primary classification system enabled 74.1 % of the cases to be assigned a relevant condition, leaving only 25.9 % as unexplained. The single largest condition associated was fetal growth restriction (25.9 %).

VNewborn Screening for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia in India: What Do We Need to Watch Out for?
p674
aVCongenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is a disorder-an ideal candidate to deserve newborn screening. CAH accounts for a significant mortality and morbidity in India, and its awareness among obstetricians should be treated as highly important to prevent the problem.It is very important for a country like India as the incidence of CAH is reasonably high justifying screening program. However, there are simple logistics that need to be followed, and the treating physicians need to be aware of, if one has to reduce the number of false positives and recalls.This article takes one through the steps involved in the analysis, interpretation, and reasons for false positives, why the false positives, so that unnecessary calls to parents for repeat sampling are minimized along with the emphasis and the need for the routine screening for CAH.The results of samples can vary depending on the gestational age of the baby, weight of the baby, sampling time, and the knowledge of these data to the treating Obstetrician and Pediatrician is of paramount importance in preventing repeat samples and frustration for the family and the people involved.

VGestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia: Experience from a Tertiary Care Center of India.
p677
aVGestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) comprise a spectrum of interrelated conditions originating from the placenta. With sensitive assays for human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG) and current approaches to chemotherapy, most women with GTN can be cured with preservation of reproductive potential. The purpose of this analysis was to address the outcome of GTN in patients from a tertiary care center of India.We undertook a retrospective and prospective review of GTN cases treated at our center over a period of 7 years from 2008 to 2014. Patients of GTN were assigned to low-risk or high-risk categories as per the FIGO scoring system. The low-risk group was treated with combination of actinomycin-D and methotrexate and the high-risk group received the Etoposide, Methotrexate, Actinomycin-D/ Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine (EMA/CO) regimen. Salvage therapy was Etoposide, Paclitaxel /Paclitaxel, Cisplatin (EP/TP). Treatment was continued for three cycles after normalization of \u03b2-hCG level, after which the patients were followed up regularly.In total, 41 GTN patients were treated at our institution during the above period; 17 were in the low-risk and 24 were in the high-risk category. The lung was the most common site of metastasis. All low-risk patients achieved complete remission. Among high-risk patients, one patient died while receiving first cycle chemotherapy, one patient relapsed, and 22 patients achieved complete remission. The single relapsed patient also achieved remission with second-line chemotherapy.Risk-stratified treatment of GTN was associated with acceptable toxicity and resulted in outcome that was comparable with international standards. The use of two-drug combination in low-risk patients is a better option especially in developing countries.

p683
aVThe aim of the present review was to identify the studies published on dental treatment under general anesthesia for special-needs patients. A comprehensive search of the reported literature from January 1966 to May 2012 was conducted using PubMed, Medline, and Embase. Keywords used in the search were "dental treatment under general anesthesia", "special-needs patients", "medically-compromised patients", and "children", in various combinations. Studies published only on dental treatment under general anesthesia and in English were included. Only 10 studies were available for final analysis. Age range from 1 to 50 years, and restorative procedures, were most prevalent. Only two studies discussed repeated general anesthesia, with rates of 7.2% and 10.2%. Over time, the provision of general anesthesia for special-needs patients has changed from dental clinics to general hospitals. The demand for dental treatment for special-needs patients under general anesthesia continues to increase. Currently, there are no certain accepted protocols for the provision of dental treatment under general anesthesia.

p686
aVLipocalin-2, a 25 kDa secretory glycoprotein, was first found in the neutrophilic granules of humans and in mouse kidney cells. It has been shown to have an important role in inflammation. The aim of this study was to determine the levels of lipocalin-2 in gingival crevicular fluid and tear fluid in patients with obesity and chronic periodontitis.A total of 40 subjects in the age group 25-40 years were divided into four groups based on probing depth, gingival index, clinical attachment level, body mass index, and radiographic evidence of bone loss. The groups were: nonobese healthy group; obese healthy group; nonobese chronic periodontitis group; obese chronic periodontitis group Gingival crevicular fluid and tear fluid samples were collected on the subsequent day.There was an increase in lipocalin-2 levels from group 1 to group 4 (with the nonobese healthy group showing the least levels and obese chronic periodontitis group showing the highest levels) in both gingival crevicular fluid and tear fluid.Lipocalin-2 may be an important inflammatory marker that may help link obesity and chronic periodontitis.

VExophytic oral verrucous hyperplasia: a new entity.
p690
aVExophytic oral verrucous hyperplasia (OVH) is a new entity described by an expert working group from South Asia. First reported in Taiwan, there are no reports so far from an Indian population. The aim was to use the microscopic features described by the expert group to differentiate OVH from other oral verruco-papillary lesions in an Indian archive.In a retrospective multicentre study, using pathology archives, 188 verruco-papillary lesions were retrieved from pathology archives. A proforma listing histopathological criteria for OVH based on published guidelines (Annals of Dentistry, University of Malaya, 2013) was used. Patients' demographic and clinical data were transcribed from patient charts. The Pearson chi-square test was used to determine associations between clinical and histopathological features.Of 188 oral verruco-papillary lesions that were evaluated, based on microscopic features the cases were reclassified as OVH (57), verrucous carcinoma (VC) (84), oral squamous cell carcinoma (16), and other verruco-papillary lesions (31). Both OVH (70%) and VC (60%) showed male predominance and commonly affected buccal mucosa (OVH 74% and VC 57%). Absence of downward growth of the hyperplastic epithelium into lamina propria when compared with the level of the basement membrane of the adjacent normal epithelium was a distinct feature in OVH. Keratin plugging, epithelial dysplasia and subepithelial lymphocytic infiltration were found to be significantly different (P < 0.05) in OVH versus VC. The sample size of other verruco-papillary lesions was insufficient for statistical comparison.Apart from the absence of an endophytic growth pattern in OVH, we noted the presence of dysplasia in OVH. This significant observation does institute a debate as to whether this enigmatic lesion could possibly be a precedent of oral squamous or verrucous carcinoma. We propose OVH is a distinct entity in our Indian population and should be considered in the classification of oral potentially malignant disorders.

Demographic data, clinical signs and risk factors for VDD, Paediatric Index of Mortality III (PRISM III) score, and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score were recorded. Plasma 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels were measured by ELISA within 24 hours of admission. The occurrence of septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and healthcare-associated infection (HCAI), need for mechanical ventilation and catecholamines, length of PICU stay and mortality were also recorded. Cases were compared with 338 apparently healthy children for baseline variables and vitamin D status.Prevalence of VDD [25(OH)D level <\u200950 nmol/L] was higher among critically ill children with sepsis compared to healthy controls (50.8% vs 40.2%, P\u2009=\u20090.04). VDD was not associated with any significant difference in baseline demographic variables or risk factors for VDD. Although there was a trend toward increased PRISM III score, septic shock, MODS, HCAI, need for mechanical ventilation and catecholamines, length of PICU stay, and mortality, the difference was not statistically significant.A high prevalence of VDD in critically ill children with sepsis was found but it was not associated with greater severity of illness or other clinical outcomes.

VCo-delivery of rapamycin- and piperine-loaded polymeric nanoparticles for breast cancer treatment.
p696
aVP-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux is the major cause of multidrug resistance (MDR) in tumors when using anticancer drugs, moreover, poor bioavailability of few drugs is also due to P-gp efflux in the gut. Rapamycin (RPM) is in the clinical trials for breast cancer treatment, but its P-gp substrate property leads to poor oral bioavailability and efficacy. The objective of this study is to formulate and evaluate nanoparticles of RPM, along with a chemosensitizer (piperine, PIP) for improved oral bioavailability and efficacy. Poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) was selected as polymer as it has moderate MDR reversal activity, which may provide additional benefits. The nanoprecipitation method was used to prepare PLGA nanoparticles with particle size below 150\u2009nm, loaded with both drugs (RPM and PIP). Prepared nanoparticles showed sustained in vitro drug release for weeks, with initial release kinetics of zero order with non-Fickian transport, subsequently followed by Higuchi kinetics with Fickian diffusion. An everted gut sac method was used to study the effect of P-gp efflux on drug transport. This reveals that the uptake of the RPM (P-gp substrate) has been increased in the presence of chemosensitizer. Pharmacokinetic studies showed better absorption profile of RPM from polymeric nanoparticles compared to its suspension counterpart and improved bioavailability of 4.8-folds in combination with a chemosensitizer. An in vitro cell line study indicates higher efficacy of nanoparticles compared to free drug solution. Results suggest that the use of a combination of PIP with RPM nanoparticles would be a promising approach in the treatment of breast cancer.

VComplete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome in Three Generations of Indian Pedigree.
p699
aVAndrogen insensitivity syndrome or testicular feminization syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive disorder, which encompasses a wide range of phenotypes that are caused by numerous different mutations in the androgen receptor gene. Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome occurs when the body cannot use androgens at all. People with this form of the condition have the external sex characteristics of females, but do not have a uterus and therefore do not menstruate and are unable to conceive a child (infertile).In this paper, we report three cases of familial complete androgen insensitivity syndrome who presented with primary amenorrhea.Physical examination, ultrasonography studies, and biochemical, karyotype, and molecular cytogenetic analyses were conducted. Based on the findings, they were diagnosed and confirmed as having complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.A multidisciplinary team is needed from disclosure of the diagnosis, gender assignment, surgical management, hormonal replacement therapy, to counseling and support.

aVTo examine Cesarean delivery rates based on the Robson's Ten-group classification system (TGCS), over a 10-year period.All Vaginal Deliveries and cesarean sections (CSs) performed over a 10-year period from 2004 to 2013 were included in the analysis. The data were compiled according to Robson's TGCS of cesarean section for every year. Risk Ratios (crude RRs) with 95 % confidence intervals for delivery by cesarean section were calculated for each Robson's group.The TGCS was easily applied in this large dataset of 40,086 deliveries. The 10-year overall cesarean section rate (CSR) was 25.17 %. Groups 1 and 3 represented 60 % of the total obstetric population. The largest contributions to the total CSR are group 1 (37.62 %) and group 5 (17.06 %). Group 3 which was the second largest group contributed 15 % to the overall CSR. Group 2 and group 4 had high group CSRs of 47.28 and 34.74 % respectively, although the total group size was small (n = 1375;3.43 %). Maternal age and presentation were found to have an independent association with mode of delivery on logistic regression.The Ten-group classification helped to identify the main groups of subjects who contribute most to the overall CSR. It also helped to identify subgroups requiring closer monitoring for more in-depth analyses of the indications for caesarean section. It is important to focus on the first four TGCS groups which constitute about 75 % of all deliveries. It is in the low-risk groups that one is likely to find the highest and most inappropriate indications for cesarean sections.

p708
aVMilk-derived bioactive peptides have been identified as potential ingredients of health-promoting functional foods. These bioactive peptides are targeted at diet-related chronic diseases especially the non-communicable diseases viz., obesity, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Peptides derived from the milk of cow, goat, sheep, buffalo and camel exert multifunctional properties, including anti-microbial, immune modulatory, anti-oxidant, inhibitory effect on enzymes, anti-thrombotic, and antagonistic activities against various toxic agents. Majority of those regulate immunological, gastrointestinal, hormonal and neurological responses, thereby playing a vital role in the prevention of cancer, osteoporosis, hypertension and other disorders as discussed in this review. For the commercial production of such novel bioactive peptides large scale technologies based on membrane separation and ion exchange chromatography methods have been developed. Separation and identification of those peptides and their pharmacodynamic parameters are necessary to transfer their potent functional properties into food applications. The present review summarizes the preliminary classes of bioactive milk-derived peptides along with their physiological functions, general characteristics and potential applications in health-care.

aVThe palatal rugae are anatomical folds or wrinkles located on the anterior third of the palate behind the incisive papilla on each side of the palatal raphe. The rugae patterns have been studied for various purposes mainly in the field of anthropology, comparative anatomy, genetics, prosthodontics, orthodontics and forensic odontology. This study is aimed to determine the difference in number and pattern of palatal rugae in males and females.This is a prospective study in which maxillary impressions of 50 volunteers, 25 males and 25 females were taken and the casts prepared. The boundaries of the rugae were marked with a HB pencil and were observed with a magnifying glass following the classification used by Kapali, et al, (1997). Association between rugae number and sex and rugae shape and sex were tested using two sample unpaired t test.The study revealed significant difference in the pattern of converge rugae which were found to be higher in females than males, however, no statistical significant difference was found in the number of rugae between the two sexes.The rugae pattern can be an additional method of differentiation between the males and females in conjunction with the other methods used in forensic sciences.

But prolonged nasogastric intubation is associated with complications like basal atelectasis due to poor cough reflux, loss of electrolytes and increased patient morbidity.To study the need for routine use of nasogastric tube post operatively in bowel surgeries with reference to (1) Return of bowel movements (2) Compare the incidence of complications (3) Duration of hospital stay.100 patients who underwent elective bowel surgery were randomized into two groups: Study group (50): Nasogastric tube was removed immediately after operation or in the recovery room. Control group (50): Underwent nasogastric tube removal postoperatively after the patient passed flatus and audible bowel sounds on auscultation.Incidence of complications were less in the study group i.e., only three patients had vomiting, and two patients had abdominal distension which lead to postponement of oral feeds. Most of our control group patients complained of discomfort and difficulty in coughing and in bringing out sputum, which was the probable cause for high incidence of pulmonary complications.Routine use of the nasogastric tube adjunct to patient care following bowel surgery may be safely eliminated.

VAcute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation II Score and its Correlation with Three Surgical Strategies for Management of Ileal Perforations.
p723
aVIleal perforation peritonitis is a common surgical emergency in the Indian subcontinent and in tropical countries. It is reported to constitute the fifth common cause of abdominal emergencies due to high incidence of enteric fever and tuberculosis in these management based on Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score.The following study was conducted in the Department of General Surgery, Government Medical College, Patiala. A total of 57 patients were studied and divided in to Group I, II, and III. APACHE II score accessed and score between 10 and 19 were blindly randomized into three procedures primary closure, resection-anastomosis, and ileostomy. The outcome was compared.Ileal perforations were most commonly observed in the third and fourth decade of life with male dominance. APACHE II score was accessed and out of total 57 patients, 6 patients had APACHE II score of 0-9, 48 patients had APACHE II score of 10-19, and 3 patients had APACHE II score of \u226520. In APACHE II score 10-19, 15 patients underwent primary closure, 16 patients underwent resection-anastomosis, and 17 patients underwent ileostomy.Primary closure of perforation is advocated in patients with single, small perforation (<1 cm) with APACHE II score 10-19 irrespective of duration of perforation. Ileostomy is advocated in APACHE II score 10-19, where the terminal ileum is grossly inflamed with multiple perforations, large perforations (>1 cm), fecal peritonitis, matted bowel loops, intraoperative evidence of caseating lymph nodes, strictures, and an unhealthy gut due to edema.

VPros and Cons of Adding of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy to Standard Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in Cervical Cancer: A Regional Cancer Center Experience.
p726
aVThe present study summarizes the results of treatment in the form of disease-free survival and overall survival in bulky stage IB2 and locally advanced (stages II-IVA) squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix. The treatment has been given in the form of NACT followed by CCRT in one arm and CCRT in the other arm.This retrospective study analyzed 713 cervical cancer patients who were treated at our center during 2007 and 2008; out of 713 patients, data of 612 patients have been compared. The patients' data were analyzed retrospectively. Patients had undergone PF 28.6 %, TPF 21.5 %, and only CCRT 49.9 %. Majority of patients were in the age group 41-50 years, while stage wise, mainly stage IIIb and IIb. Disease-free survival was observed on the basis of stage and NACT. The survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. All statistical calculations were done with SPSS Statistics version 20.0.For cancer cervix NACT versus CCRT, the DFS rate was at 5 years (58.3 vs. 41.8 % p = 0.001). NACT followed by CCRT demonstrated significantly superior DFS as compared to definitive CCRT, respectively, TPF (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.248, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.123-0.500; p < 0.001), PF (HR = 0.445, 95 % CI 0.266-0.722; p = 0.002). The results of univariate stage, age, and multivariate study show that stage hemoglobin level, interval between external-intracavitary radiation, and type of neoadjuvant chemotherapy were the factors affected survival cervical patients treated with radiation. The grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities were more in the NACT group than CCRT (p < 0.001) while the non-hematological toxicity was not significant; the TPF group experienced more toxicity than PF (p = 0.029). This treatment regimen is feasible as evidenced by the acceptable toxicity of NACT and by the high compliance to radiotherapy. The grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities were more in NACT groups than CCRT (p < 0.001); the TPF group experienced more toxicity than PF (p = 0.029).TPF/PF as NACT is feasible and produces impressive responses in cancer cervix.

aVThe objective of this study was to prospectively analyze the risks and benefits of total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) compared with total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) and the effects of learning curve on them over 4 years (March 2010-April 2014).It was a prospective randomized study.The study was conducted in Delhi government hospital which had no staff with previous experience of advanced laparoscopic surgeries.Two hundred fifty patients were operated on for benign gynecological conditions (35-65 years). The numbers of cases operated laparoscopically were as follows-22 in 2010, 25 in 2011, 32 in 2012, and 46 in 2013. Equal number. of patients operated by open surgery were taken in the study during the same time period.Two hundred fifty cases were operated since March 2010, by either laparoscopic or open surgery. Incidence of major complications was-1.6 % for TLH compared to 4 % in TAH. After the first year of surgery, this incidence has fallen to 0 % in subsequent years in TLH group. The incidence of minor complications declined from 14 to 4.5 % in the third year of study. Total rate of conversion to laparotomy was 9.7 %, which again had a significant decline after the first year. TLH also clearly showed superior benefits of less intraoperative blood loss, early postoperative ambulance, and shorter period of hospital stay in comparison with TAH.The study has led us to conclude that TLH is a safe, effective, and reproducible technique after the completion of a period of training necessary to standardize the procedure. This approach must be established in our real, day-to-day clinical practice.

These challenges are (i) Lack of proper health care infrastructure and human resources suitable for haemophilia care (ii) Competing health care priorities of the government. (iii) Lack of penetrance of medical insurance in the population. (iv) Lesser visibility of the haemophilia patients in health care system (v) Low awareness across the medical profession, population and the policy makers about the condition (vi) Non availability of factor concentrates (vii) Inadequate utilization of knowledge for reducing factor concentrate use. (viii) Inadequate pain relief (ix) Challenges due to inhibitor developing (x) Viral hepatitis & (xi) Lack of research publications relevant to the country are some of the challenges faced by PWH for their management in developing country. The solutions are not easy but development of a strong patient organization with linkages with World Federation of Haemophilia is an important initial step. Following that internal and international twinning, use of internal sources, strong advocacy programme targeting government, doctors, opinion makers will solve many of the challenges in the time to come.

VActive Hemovigilance Significantly Improves Reporting of Acute Non-infectious Adverse Reactions to Blood Transfusion.
p736
aVOne of the key purposes of a hemovigilance program is to improve reporting of transfusion related adverse events and subsequent data-driven improvement in blood transfusion (BT) practices. We conducted a study over 3 years to assess the impact of healthcare worker training and an active feedback programme on reporting of adverse reactions to BTs. All hospitalized patients who required a BT were included in the study. Healthcare workers involved in BT to patients were sensitized and trained in adverse reaction reporting by conducting training sessions and meetings. All the transfused patients were 'actively' monitored for any acute adverse reaction by using a uniquely coded blood issue form. A total of 18,914 blood components transfused to 5785 different patients resulted in 61 adverse reaction episodes. This incidence of 0.32 % in our study was found to be significantly higher (p < 0.005) than that reported from the same region in the past. Red blood cell units were the most frequently transfused component and thus most commonly involved in an adverse reaction (42.6 %), however apheresis platelets had the highest chance of reaction per unit transfused (0.66 %). There was no mortality associated with the BT during the study period. An active surveillance program significantly improves reporting and management of adverse reactions to BTs.

VA Randomized Control Study to Evaluate Effects of Short-term Oral Iron Supplementation in Regular Voluntary Blood Donors.
p739
aVRegular blood donation can lead to iron deficiency anaemia. Early recognition and reversal of excessive iron loss by iron supplementation may avoid symptomatic iron store depletion in blood donors. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of iron supplementation in maintaining the iron stores of voluntary blood donors. A total of 200 regular volunteers who donated twice in previous year were randomly divided into two groups. Iron: oral iron supplementation tablets of elemental iron as ferrous fumarate. Placebo group: glucose containing capsules, to be taken once daily for 21 days after one unit of blood donation. Their hemogram, serum ferritin, red cell indices and red cell distribution width were determined at baseline and after 1 month and at the time of next blood donation. Out of 200 volunteers enrolled 98 were assigned to iron group and rest 102 into placebo group. Total of 37 % donors dropped out, yielding a dropout rate of 35 % in iron group and 39 % in the placebo group. The haemoglobin and ferritin levels showed significant improvement in iron group compared to placebo group (p < 0.05). Three weeks of oral iron therapy (98.6 mg elemental iron/day) was able to maintain iron stores at 1 month after donation but was not sufficient to sustain the iron stores over a period of 3 months. Thus there is need to evaluate increased dosage or duration of iron supplementation in maintaining the iron stores.

VNon Infectious Complications Related to Blood Transfusion: An 11 year Retrospective Analysis in a Tertiary Care Hospital.
p742
aVIn India transmission of transfusion transmissible infections (TTI) has shown a relative decrease as a result of mandatory screening of donated blood for TTI's. However, reducing the incidence of non infectious complications poses a major challenge, mainly due to the fact that a number of adverse reactions go unreported. Blood transfusion reaction, can be categorized based on the time interval between transfusion of blood products and the presentation of adverse reactions as acute i.e. those presenting during or within 24 h and as delayed i.e. those presenting anytime after 24 h. Transfusion reactions can further be classified as immune and non immune or infectious and non infectious based on the pathophysiology. In this retrospective study which was undertaken with an aim to determine the type and frequency of non infectious complications due to transfusion of blood and blood products recorded the incidence of febrile non hemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR) 51.40 %, allergic reactions 40.14 %, non immune hemolytic reactions 4.22 %, hypothermia 2.81 %, anaphylaxis 0.70 % and iron overload 0.70 %. FNHTR which was found to be the most common complication in this study can certainly be minimized, if not completely eliminated by adopting a policy of universal leucodepletion, the implementation of which solely depends on the financial and infrastructure resources available. This study also reiterates the importance of hemovigilance as a tool to improve the safety of blood transfusion.

VMorbidity index: A score to assess immediate postoperative recovery in TKR patients.
p745
aVEvery surgical procedure involves certain amount of postoperative morbidity which varies among different surgeries and the same surgery done by different techniques. Minimally invasive surgeries have evolved in all surgical branches and are believed to have a lesser morbidity than the traditional procedures; however there is no score or index to assess the immediate recovery after any surgical procedure in the literature. We tried to devise an immediate postoperative assessment method that takes into account the early recovery phase of patient post total knee arthroplasty (TKA) from day1 to day3. We called it as morbidity index. It consists of a 10 different parameters which could overall assess the patient's postoperative recovery.A prospective study was conducted in order to evaluate feasibility of the morbidity index and its usefulness in assessing the immediate postoperative recovery in TKA. We evaluated 50 consecutive TKA patients and scored at day 1, day 2 and day 3 postoperatively by a morbidity index.The mean score on day one was 13.88 which decreased to 4.68 by day three indicating morbidity has decreased.The morbidity index can be a tool to assess the immediate postoperative recovery of the patient after TKA and can be used to compare different approaches and procedure.

VMetastatic Follicular Carcinoma Thyroid Masquerading as a Primary Jaw Tumor.
p749
aVMetastatic tumours of the oral cavity are rare constituting approximately one percent of all oral malignancies. These tumors are clinically significant as their appearance may be the first indication of an undiscovered malignancy at a distant primary site or the first evidence of dissemination from a known primary tumor. Thyroid cancer metastasizing to the jaw bones is a rare occurrence and very few cases have been described in literature. We present an additional case which in fact masqueraded as a primary jaw tumor. Metastasis to jaw bones is generally associated with poor prognosis with a majority of the patients dying within 6 months of diagnosis. Thyroid cancers however seem to be an exception to this, resectable solitary jaw bone metastasis from differentiated thyroid cancers is associated with a much better prognosis and therefore should be considered for metastatectomy.

Here we discuss a case of clinically significant naturally occurring anti-M antibody had both IgM and IgG components in a 3 years old child who was a hematopoietic stem cell donor for her 6 years old sister suffering from beta-thalassemia major. The specificity and immunoglobulin class of the antibody was confirmed by antibody screening at wide thermal range, dithiothreitol treatment of serum and reaction of serum with enzyme treated panel cells.

aVParathyroid adenoma usually presents with the signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia due to hyperparathyroidism. Brown's tumor is the late clinical consequence of untreated hyperparathyroidism and is rarely seen now-a-days due to improved screening biochemical tests. These tumors are characterized by high orthoclastic activity and bone resorption. These are usually located in the pelvis, ribs, clavicles, and extremities. This manuscript highlights a rare presentation of brown's tumor of upper alveolus in a 35-year-old female with a previously undiagnosed case of hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma. Blood analysis depicted high levels of serum calcium and parathyroid hormone. The patient was subjected to selective left lower parathyroidectomy and will receive follow-up to prevent further developments of the disease. Clinicians should be aware of such rare presentation of parathyroid adenomas so that unnecessary extensive surgery of brown's tumor is avoided. This case also highlights the need of detailed work up to arrive at an exact diagnosis and direct surgical intervention to the adenoma rather the secondary manifestation of the disease.

World Health Organization considers it as a true benign neoplasm of vascular origin, and many authors believe it to be a hamartoma. It is very difficult to diagnose due to variable clinical and radiological features. A biopsy is not done on a routine basis due to a higher risk of hemorrhage.

In spite of the development of a myriad of surgical approaches to the TMJ, FN remains at risk. The deep subfascial approach provides an additional layer of protection (the deep layer of the temporalis fascia and the superficial temporal fat pad) to the temporal and zygomatic branches of the FN and thus, is the safest method to avoid FN injury.To assess FN injury following TMJ surgery using deep subfascial approach and measuring it on House and Brackman facial nerve grading system (HBFNGS).Twenty TMJs in 18 patients were operated for TMJ ankylosis, using "the deep subfascial approach." FN function was assessed postoperatively at 24 h, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months using HBFNGS. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS 16.0.Of 20 surgical sites 3 sites showed Grade III (moderate) FN injury and 17 sites showed Grade II (mild) FN injury at 24 h. The condition improved with time with full recovery of FN at all surgical sites at 6 months.The deep subfascial approach has a distinct advantage over the conventional approaches when dissecting the temporal region and is the safest method to avoid injury to FN.

aVThe role of trace elements in various diseases has been a matter of controversy with various authors reporting on conflicting data. They are receiving much attention in the detection of oral cancer and precancer as they are found to be significantly altered and have an important role in carcinogenesis. Trace elements have been extensively studied in the recent years to assess whether they have any modifying effect in the etiology of oral malignant conditions.A study was conducted on fifty subjects with clinically diagnosed oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) and fifty controls with no apparent lesions of the oral mucosa and without any areca nut-related oral habit.The level of serum zinc was significantly (P < 0.0001) lower among cases (73.48 ± 24.21) compared with controls (119.48 ± 52.78). However, the serum copper level was significantly (P < 0.0001) higher among cases (155.50 ± 40.13) than controls (100.40 ± 24.52). The level of serum iron was observed to be lower among the cases (66.57 ± 27.76) as compared to controls (94.19 ± 35.70), and the difference was statistically significant.It can be concluded from this study that serum zinc, copper, and iron levels could be used as a potential prognostic and diagnostic markers in OSMF patients.

Despite successful campaigns to help people shun this habit in developing countries the incidence has rather gone up and HPV and sexual practices are now definitely implicated for this.An attempt was made to generate Indian data on role of HPV and sexual practices in relation to OSCC.A prospective observational study was conducted on 50 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.Tissue biopsies from fifty patients of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) were subjected to PCR analysis to look for presence of HPV 16 and 18. Fifty patients with benign lesions were taken as control.The data was statistically analysed using SPSS version 22 and chi square test.42% of OSCC patients were found to harbour HPV 16 and 18 whereas only 8% of patients with benign lesions had HPV 16 and 18. A significant number of HPV positive patients i.e. 9 out of 21 gave history of multiple sexual partners and oral sex.This high percentage of HPV in OSCC in an Indian population from a tertiary care centre in north India and its association with prevailing sexual practices is quite significant.

VRetromandibular approach in the management of condylar fractures by open reduction and internal fixation a prospective study.
p812
aVTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of the retromandibular approach in the management of condylar fractures by open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF).A total of 20 patients with unilateral mandibular condylar fractures underwent ORIF using retromandibular approach. Pertinent data were collected and subjected to evaluation.The retromandibular approach was found to be expeditious in adequately exposing the fracture site and enabling ORIF. The anatomic reduction of the fractured segments and the fixation was satisfactory in all the cases. Average duration of surgery was 39 min (range: 17-56 min) for satisfactory exposure, reduction, and fixation of each condylar fracture.The retromandibular approach provides adequate exposure of the subcondylar region and should be considered as commendable alternative in the management of condylar fractures.

VFucose: A biomarker in grading of oral cancer.
p815
aVEarly diagnosis of cancer helps a great deal in the management of oral cancer patients. Number of proteinous markers have been employed for this purpose. Majority of them are not specific. Recently conjugated oligosaccharide with proteins and lipids have gained considerable importance in the present postgenomics and postproteomic period in the diagnostic and prognostics of cancer cases.In this study, serum fucose levels were estimated in 50 control cases and 75 cases of oral cancer by the method of Dische and Shettles as adopted by Winzler.Serum fucose levels were found to be significantly higher in oral cancer cases (46.63 ± 5.29 mg/dl) as compared to the control cases (7.22 ± 0.26 mg/dl). The stepwise elevated serum fucose levels were found to be correlated with the histopathological grading of oral cancer.Estimation of such fucose conjugated proteins is suggestive to be good biomarkers in the diagnosis of oral cancer cases as well as in assessing the prognosis of such cases.

VCamel bite: An uncommon mode of maxillofacial injury, its mechanism and fatality: Case series and review of literature.
p818
aVMaxillofacial injuries are presented with many different patterns. It mostly depends upon the mode of injury like physical assault, road traffic accidents, occupational injuries, fall, sport injuries and animal attacks. Animals bites are common with wild animals but attack from an otherwise calm animal like camel is unusual and unexpected. They may cause a severe kind of maxillofacial injury which ranges from minor lacerations to total loss of soft and hard tissues. Such incidences are frequently seen in Rajasthan, India where camels are kept as a pet. Present study throws light on literature related to animal bite injuries and their management along with our experience with camel bite injuries.Twenty patients (19 male and 1 female) of different age groups with variable extent of maxillofacial trauma induced by camel attacks were included in the study. Among them, different patterns of maxillofacial injuries were observed involving both soft and hard tissue.This study provides the comprehensive incidence, pathophysiology, and management of camel inflicted injuries. Understanding the behavior patterns of this animal may prevent such severe injuries.

VPrimary malignant melanoma of oral cavity: A tertiary care center experience.
p821
aVPrimary mucosal malignant melanoma is an extremely rare, aggressive neoplasm accounting for 0.5% of all oral malignancies. Any pigmented lesion in oral cavity should have an index of suspicion, which should be investigated to detect the disease at an early stage and managed appropriately. Melanomas tend to invade locally into the tissue or metastasize more commonly than other malignant tumors of the oral cavity.We report a retrospective case series of eight patients suffering from primary oral malignant melanoma treated in our department between 2012 and 2014. The details were recorded from the departmental computerized database and patients on follow-up.There were six male and two female patients with a mean age of 46.8 years. Hard palate was the most common affected site in oral cavity. Pigmented lesion\u005culcer was the most common presenting symptom. Majority of patients (5 patients) were diagnosed with Stage III (distant metastasis), two patients in Stage II, and one patient in Stage I. Three patients were treated with definitive surgery and five patients with palliative chemotherapy in view of distant disease. Following surgery, two of them required adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in view of nodal spread. Patients had a mean follow-up of 10.5 months (range: 8-26 months). Patients treated with definitive surgery had a mean survival rate of 16 months (range: 10-26 months), with local recurrence in one patient. Metastatic melanoma patients treated with palliative chemotherapy had a mean disease control rate of 5 months (range 5-9 months).Oral melanoma carries dismal prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of 5-20%. Early detection of the lesion, proper evaluation, and appropriate treatment are very important to cure the disease.

VRadiation-induced dental caries, prevention and treatment - A systematic review.
p824
aVTreatment of head and neck cancers (HNCs) involves radiotherapy. Patients undergoing radiotherapy for HNCs are prone to dental complications. Radiotherapy to the head and neck region causes xerostomia and salivary gland dysfunction which dramatically increases the risk of dental caries and its sequelae. Radiation therapy (RT) also affects the dental hard tissues increasing their susceptibility to demineralization following RT. Postradiation caries is a rapidly progressing and highly destructive type of dental caries. Radiation-related caries and other dental hard tissue changes can appear within the first 3 months following RT. Hence, every effort should be focused on prevention to manage patients with severe caries. This can be accomplished through good preoperative dental treatment, frequent dental evaluation and treatment after RT (with the exception of extractions), and consistent home care that includes self-applied fluoride. Restorative management of radiation caries can be challenging. The restorative dentist must consider the altered dental substrate and a hostile oral environment when selecting restorative materials. Radiation-induced changes in enamel and dentine may compromise bonding of adhesive materials. Consequently, glass ionomer cements have proved to be a better alternative to composite resins in irradiated patients. Counseling of patients before and after radiotherapy can be done to make them aware of the complications of radiotherapy and thus can help in preventing them.

VApplications of botulinum toxin in dentistry: A comprehensive review.
p827
aVThe horizons of treatment options in dentistry are broadening rapidly. In this scenario, applications of unconventional treatment options like use of botulinum toxin (BT) are gaining momentum. The use of BT has been popularly accepted in esthetic procedures like management of facial wrinkles; however, it has been documented to be successful in a variety of conditions. Of particular interest to this paper are applications of BT in the maxillofacial region, concerned to dentistry. BT offers a transient, reversible, relatively safe treatment option to many conditions of interest to a dental practitioner. Dental surgeons by their virtue of being extensively aware of the anatomy of faciomaxillary region are a potential pool of operators who can use BT in their armamentarium with minor skill enhancement and thus widen the perspective of alternative, minimally invasive options to refractory conditions or invasive protocols.

VAccidental aspiration/ingestion of foreign bodies in dentistry: A clinical and legal perspective.
p830
aVThe potential of foreign body aspiration or ingestion is a worldwide health problem in dentistry. The general dental practitioners should be extremely attentive in handling of minor instruments during any intervention related to the oral cavity, especially in the supine or semi-recumbent position of the patient. Aspiration cases are usually more critical and less common than ingestion. We report a case of iatrogenic aspiration of an endodontic broach, which gets disclosed during the recording of past dental history of the patient. The patient was asymptomatic during that time. A quick posterior-anterior chest radiograph was taken which revealed the presence of broach in the lower lobe of the left lung. The patient was immediately referred to the pulmonary medicine department where the fiberoptic bronchoscope retrieval was planned, and the same was carried out successfully under local anesthesia. Although such accidents have rare occurrence, the associated risks and morbidity are too high to be overlooked, especially from the viewpoint of special care, resources, and the associated financial cost required for their management. Moreover, practitioners are also liable for malpractice litigation given the fact that such cases are avoidable. This article also discusses relevant review literature, risk factors, symptoms, and management of such iatrogenic accidents along with drawing attention to the significance of preventive measures and their role in avoiding meritorious legal and ethical issues.

NICU admissions-RR 3.94 (95 % CI 1.92-8.09), respiratory distress-RR 5.255 (95 % CI 1.9-14.4), ventilatory usage, and hospitalization stay (P value < 0.05) were higher in neonates born at 37(0/7-6/7) versus 39(0/7-6/7) weeks (least morbidity group).Despite recommendations, more than one-third of term babies are delivered electively at <39 weeks. The fivefold augmented respiratory morbidity and fourfold increased NICU admissions in early term neonates, and the least morbidity in neonates delivered at 39 weeks emphasize the importance of restricting the non-emergent/elective deliveries to 39 weeks of gestation.

VApolipoprotein A-I: A Molecule of Diverse Function.
p843
aVApolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) an indispensable component and a major structural protein of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), plays a vital role in reverse cholesterol transport and cellular cholesterol homeostasis since its identification. Its multifunctional role in immunity, inflammation, apoptosis, viral, bacterial infection etc. has crossed its boundary of its potential of protecting cardiovascular system and lowering cardiovascular disease risk, attributing HDL to be known as a protective fat removal particle. Its structural homology with prostacyclin stabilization factor has contributed to its anti-clotting and anti-aggregatory effect on platelet which has potentiated its cardio-protective role as well as its therapeutic efficacy against Alzheimer's disease. The binding affinity and neutralising action against endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, reduces the toxic manifestations of septic shock. As a negative acute phase protein, it blocks T-cell signalling of macrophages. However the recently identified anti-tumor activity of apo A-I has been highlighted in various models of melanoma, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, lymphoblastic leukaemia, gastric as well as pancreatic cancers. These cancer fighting effects are directed towards regression of tumor size and distant metastasis by its immuno modulatory activity as well as its clearing effect on serum lysophospholipids. This lowering effect on lysophospholipid concentration is utilized by apo A-I mimetic peptides to be used in retarding tumor cell proliferation and as a potential cancer therapeutic agent. Not only that, it inhibits the tumor associated neo-angiogenesis as well as brings down the matrix degrading enzymes associated with tumor metastasis. However this efficient therapeutic potential of apo A-I as an anti tumor agent awaits further future experimental studies in humans.

It was further aimed to find out difference in Vasarishta samples manufactured by purely fermentation process and the peculiar method mentioned above.Three batches of MS and subsequently three batches of Vasarishta were prepared. Basic standardization and development of standard operating procedure for the same were achieved by doing pH, percentage of alcohol and total reducing sugar, specific gravity on both MS and Vasarishta, during and after completion of process. Finally, MS and Vasarishta (built upon MS) made in laboratory were compared with marketed samples of MS and Vasarishta using gas chromatography.The types of alcohols and volatile acids in MS and Vasarishta, prepared in laboratory, are similar but the proportions differ, which is taken as an indicator of process standardization. Values of furfural, ethyl acetate, and 1-butanol in lab samples are within permissible limits as against the values of the market samples.The textual process for the production of Vasarishta proved to produce organoleptically acceptable product which is virtually free of toxic compounds such as furfural.

As there are no comprehensive guidelines for stability testing of herbal products, there is a need for a sensitive tool to detect how the quality of herbal products varies with time under the influence of environmental conditions.To validate the employability of high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) for real-time stability of Hutabhugadi Churna (HC).The chromatograms were developed using toluene/ethyl acetate/formic acid (10:5:1) and ethyl acetate/formic acid (10:1) as a mobile phase for chloroform and ethanolic extract, respectively. The plates were scanned under 254, 366, 540 (pre-derivatization) and 540 nm (post-derivatization). Samples were analyzed immediately after preparation and after 3(rd) and 6(th) months of storage. Alteration of fingerprint profiles from the initial pattern, in terms of number of peaks, was employed as diagnostic tools. Percentage variation in composition at given period was calculated.HC is found to be stable at room temperature up to 1.3 months using the method of calculation of 10% degradation period employing slope and intercept values for the initial, 3(rd) and 6(th) months' deviation in number of bands. The data obtained were subjected to regression analysis in context to number of bands obtained. The curve was found to be linear with R(2) value of 0.89-0.96 supported by their tolerance range of 0.04-0.11.The proposed model is a new logic with prospects to become working method for stability assessment of polyherbal formulations under controlled conditions.

Though it is in use since a long time, it is not yet evaluated for its nutritive value.The leaves of R. hypocrateriformis were evaluated for its nutritive value and antioxidant potential.The in vitro antioxidant properties of the leaf of R. hypocrateriformis were screened through 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and total antioxidant capacity. Phytochemicals, crude protein, fat, carbohydrate, energy value, and mineral content of the leaves of the plant were evaluated with standard procedures.In phytochemical analysis, tannin, alkaloids, flavonoids, and carbohydrates were present in leaf powder of R. hypocrateriformis. Energy content was found to be highest (331.54 kcals/100 g). Carbohydrate, fat, protein, calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, and zinc were present in 57.63%, 2.66%, 19.27%, 0.99%, 0.34%, 0.32%, and 0.011%, respectively. The IC50 values of the extract and ascorbic acid were found to be 254 ± 5.29 \u03bcg/ml and 11.67 ± 0.58 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. Percentage scavenging of DPPH radical was found to rise with increasing concentration of the crude extract. Total antioxidant capacity of the extract was found to be 111.30 ± 0.003 mcg.The results of this study indicate that the leaves of R. hypocrateriformis contain secondary metabolites such as tannin and possess mild antioxidant properties. Nutritional analysis indicates the presence of energy in highest amount, carbohydrates, proteins, fats, calcium, phosphorous, zinc, and magnesium.

Amalaki (Phyllanthus emblica L.) has Tridoshahara, especially Pittashamaka (pacifying Pitta) and Rasayana (rejuvenative) properties, thus nourishes the Dhatus and is also known to enhance the absorption of iron.To evaluate the efficacy of Amalaki Rasayana in the management of Pandu w.s.r. IDA.A randomized controlled open clinical trial was conducted at Institute for Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda, Jamnagar. Iron deficient anemic patients (n = 25) having Hb <12g% in females and 13g% in males and S.Iron <50mg/dl were selected and divided into two groups. Group A was given 2 g of Amalaki Rasayana thrice a day with unequal quantity of honey and ghee for 45 days, while Group B was given 150 mg ferrous fumarate + 1500 mcg folic acid (standard control) once a day with water for 45 days. Assessment was done on the basis of relief in cardinal symptoms of Pandu and hematological parameters.The formulation showed highly significant relief in Panduta (pallor), Daurbalya (weakness), Shirahshoola (headache), Shrama (fatigue), and Gaurava (heaviness) while statistically significant relief in Aruchi (anorexia) and Pindikodweshtan (leg cramps) was reported. On hematological parameters statistically significant increase was found in mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin while on biochemical markers statistically significant decrease was found in total iron binding capacity only. However the formulation was not found as effective as standard control.

In Ayurveda visual disturbances are described in the context of Timira, Kacha and Linganasha. Timira is an early stage characterized by blurring of vision and Linganasha is end stage where complete loss of vision occurs. Ancient scholars have advocated different Anjana application and oral medications in the Timira and Kacha stage.To study the efficacy of test drugs Triphaladi Ghana Vati and Elaneer Kuzhambu Anjana in immature cataract.In this trial patients having Senile Immature Cataract were randomized with equal probability to one of the two treatment Groups A and B (n = 20 each). In Group A Triphaladi Ghana Vati 500 mg internally for 3 months and in Group B Triphaladi Ghana Vati 500 mg internally and Elaneer Kuzhambu Anjana for local application were given. Assessment was done on the basis of blurring of vision, visualization of nonexisting things, difficulty in bright light and dim light or night vision, distant visual acuity, pinhole vision, best corrected visual acuity and cataract grading on slit lamp.Both groups showed statistically significant changes in blurring of vision, difficulty in glare, daytime and bright light, distant visual activity, pinhole vision, and best-corrected visual acuity. Group B also showed significant changes in difficulty in night time, visualization of nonexisting things and in nuclear cataract.The study establishes that test drugs can reduce and control the progress of immature cataract, and combined therapy was found more effective. Chakshushya Rasayana, early diagnosis and proper management on Doshic lines can prevent arrest or delay senile cataract.

aVDental caries is a universal disease. Dietary modification is important in reducing the occurrence of dental caries. Tea which is so frequently consumed with cariogenic starch rich food is proposed to have anticariogenic potential. The various mechanism has been proposed for same and one being inhibition of salivary amylase activity.To determine the effect of 1.5% black tea decoction on salivary amylase activity in children with high caries and no caries.A total of 30 children in the age group of 12-15 years were selected for the study. They were further grouped based on their decayed missing filled surface (DMFS) score into high-caries group (DMFS above 10) and no-caries group (DMFS = 0). After 2 h of fasting, subjects consumed two salted crackers for 60 s following which they rinsed with water and then with black tea decoction (1.5%) the very next day. Retained food particles were recovered salivary amylase activity was noted as maltose to sucrose ratio via chromatography.The average ratio of maltose to sucrose ratio percentage reduction in high-caries group was 43.63% and 41.17% in no caries group which was highly significant (P < 0.005) while the intergroup comparison was found statistically insignificant.Tea decoction has inhibitory effect on salivary amylase activity thus dental caries. The effect was statistically insignificant in children with high- and no-caries index.

VEfficacy of Vasa Avaleha and its granules on Tamaka Shwasa (bronchial asthma): Open-label randomized clinical study.
p893
aVBronchial asthma is one of the chronic inflammatory disorders of the respiratory tract causing a huge number of deaths annually. Increased industrialization and pollution are the exacerbating factors for this situation. In Ayurveda, this miserable condition is comparable with Tamaka Shwasa. Synthetic drugs provide instant symptomatic relief in cases of bronchial asthma but are known to develop certain adverse drug reactions. Considering this, the current suffering population is looking hopefully towards other systems of medicine such as Ayurveda for better relief. Ayurveda has a number of formulations to treat Tamaka Shwasa and is in practice with proven efficacy.To evaluate comparative clinical efficacy of Vasa Avaleha (VA) and its granules (GVA) in cases of Tamaka Shwasa.A total of 66 patients were registered and randomly grouped into A and B. Patients of Group A were treated with VA, while Group B with GVA at dose of 6 g twice a day with lukewarm water for the duration of 28 days. Follow-up was done after 14 days. The results were assessed in terms of clinical recovery, symptomatic relief, and pulmonary function improvement. Effect of the treatment was assessed based on subjective and objective parameters.Significant improvement was observed in most of the cardinal and associated symptoms. Significant increase in peak expiratory flow rate, considerable decrease in absolute eosinophil count, and increased breath holding time were noticed. Withdrawal of modern emergency drugs, decreased frequency of attacks, improved quality of life were the major observations noticed in both groups.This study highlights the significance of traditional herbal formulations in noncommunicable diseases such as bronchial asthma, which can be used as an effective drug in place or along with modern drugs.

VEffect of Tinospora cordifolia on physical and cardiovascular performance induced by physical stress in healthy human volunteers.
p897
aVIn Ayurveda Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers., has been used for its Rasayana, Deepana, Jwaranashana, Tridosha Shamaka properties. It is an immunomodulator, useful in stress, hyperlipidemia, pyrexia. T. cordifolia was evaluated for adaptogenic activity in healthy volunteers during exercise.The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of T. cordifolia on physical performance, and secondary objectives were to evaluate muscle power, maximal oxygen consumption, and sympathetic activity in comparison with placebo when subjected to physical stress.A total of thirty participants were randomly assigned into three groups (n = 10 each) namely placebo, TC 150 and TC 300. Placebo group received maize starch capsule, TC 150 and TC 300 received 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively of T. cordifolia aqueous extract in capsule form once daily in the morning for 28 days. The assessment was performed at baseline visit, day 14 and 28. Physical stressors were cycle ergometer exercise, Jammer's hand-held dynamometer, and cold pressor tests. Physical performance evaluated was maximum distance and speed, oxygen consumption (VO2 max), and hand grip strength. Cardiovascular response was assessed by multiple heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) measurements during each test.On day 28, TC 150 mg group showed a significant increase in mean maximum speed compared to placebo. On day 14 and 28, TC 300 mg group showed a significant decrease in mean systolic BP (SBP) and HR on fixed workload exercise compared to placebo. There was significant increasing dose effect of both TC groups on SBP on day 14 and 28 and on HR on day 28 only. On day 14 and 28, TC 300 mg showed a significant decrease in mean HR on the cold pressor test, compared to placebo.T. cordifolia improved physical performance and suppressed over activation of the sympathetic nervous system showing its adaptogenic property.

VReporting ethics committee approval and informed consent: Review of an Ayurvedic journal.
p900
aVReporting of ethical approval and informed consent in clinical research articles involving human subjects is necessary as per the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE).To assess the reporting of ethics committee approval and informed consent in clinical research articles published in AYU journal.This was a retrospective analysis of published articles in AYU from 2012 to 2014. All original articles (clinical research) were included. Data was collected to note - Ethics Committee approval and written informed consent (assent from children when applicable). Descriptive statistics was used to report the findings.A total of 104 articles were included in this analysis. Of these, 38 articles included children. Ethics committee approval was reported in 53 (51.0%) articles and consent was also reported in 51 (49.0%) articles. Thirty-eight (36.5%) articles reported both ethics committee approval and consent, whereas 38 (36.5%) articles did not report both. Only five articles reported consent from guardian or parent whereas none of the articles were reported assent.Findings from this study demonstrate that Ayurvedic clinical research articles lack in reporting ethics committee approval and written informed consent.

VLiterature searches on Ayurveda: An update.
p903
aVThe journals that publish on Ayurveda are increasingly indexed by popular medical databases in recent years. However, many Eastern journals are not indexed biomedical journal databases such as PubMed. Literature searches for Ayurveda continue to be challenging due to the nonavailability of active, unbiased dedicated databases for Ayurvedic literature. In 2010, authors identified 46 databases that can be used for systematic search of Ayurvedic papers and theses. This update reviewed our previous recommendation and identified current and relevant databases.To update on Ayurveda literature search and strategy to retrieve maximum publications.Author used psoriasis as an example to search previously listed databases and identify new. The population, intervention, control, and outcome table included keywords related to psoriasis and Ayurvedic terminologies for skin diseases. Current citation update status, search results, and search options of previous databases were assessed. Eight search strategies were developed. Hundred and five journals, both biomedical and Ayurveda, which publish on Ayurveda, were identified. Variability in databases was explored to identify bias in journal citation.Five among 46 databases are now relevant - AYUSH research portal, Annotated Bibliography of Indian Medicine, Digital Helpline for Ayurveda Research Articles (DHARA), PubMed, and Directory of Open Access Journals. Search options in these databases are not uniform, and only PubMed allows complex search strategy. "The Researches in Ayurveda" and "Ayurvedic Research Database" (ARD) are important grey resources for hand searching. About 44/105 (41.5%) journals publishing Ayurvedic studies are not indexed in any database. Only 11/105 (10.4%) exclusive Ayurveda journals are indexed in PubMed.AYUSH research portal and DHARA are two major portals after 2010. It is mandatory to search PubMed and four other databases because all five carry citations from different groups of journals. The hand searching is important to identify Ayurveda publications that are not indexed elsewhere. Availability information of citations in Ayurveda libraries from National Union Catalogue of Scientific Serials in India if regularly updated will improve the efficacy of hand searching. A grey database (ARD) contains unpublished PG/Ph.D. theses. The AYUSH portal, DHARA (funded by Ministry of AYUSH), and ARD should be merged to form single larger database to limit Ayurveda literature searches.

VMyositis Ossificans of Rectus Femoris: A Rare Case Report.
p908
aVMyositis ossificans (MO), heterotopic ossification, occurs in muscles and soft tissue. This lesion contains actively proliferating fibroblasts and osteoblasts. It commonly affects vigorous young men and more so among athletes. It occurs as a result of trauma, either acute or chronic and can also arise near joints in neurological disorders. By time of presentation, ossification is extensive and the benign nature of the lesion is usually evident on radiological studies. Most common muscles involved in MO are the flexor muscles of the arm, the hamstrings and quadriceps femoris.We present a case of MO with isolated involvement of rectus femoris in mid-thigh and sparing of other three muscles of quadriceps femoris, with no improvement following physiotherapy and medical management requiring surgical excision for better prognosis with no recurrence.MO, a benign lesion, is known to affect the flexors of the arm, the hamstrings, and quadriceps femoris; it must be noted that even individual muscle can also be affected as shown in the above case presentation without involving whole group of muscles. Surgical excision is indicated if non-operative measures are not successful.

VDegenerative Sacrolisthesis of S1-S2: A Case Report.
p911
aVDegenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) is usually seen at L4-L5 level and less frequently at L5-S1 level. This is a rare case report of spondylolisthesis of S1 over S2 with lumbarization of S1. Lumbarization of S1 is seen in just 1-2% of the population and to have spondylolisthesis in this segment is even rarer. The purpose is to report a rare case of DS at S1-S2 level.This is a single case report of a 66-year-old gentleman who presented with complains of lower backache for 2 years and acute retention of urine to the emergency department. Detailed clinical and radiological evaluation of the spine was done which revealed lumbarization of S1 with spondylolisthesis at S1-S2 and facetal hypertrophy at L5, S1, and S2. He underwent decompression and stabilization at L5, S1, and S2 along with placement of autologous bone graft. The bladder symptoms disappeared after 3 weeks. At 1-year follow-up, patient's clinical symptoms were relieved, and he improved clinically.To the best of our knowledge, this is probably the first case of DS of sacral vertebrae to be reported in English literature. The prevalence of complete lumbarization is around 1.8% and to get spondylolisthesis in this segment is even rarer, hence the lack of literature in this regard. Since this is the first of its kind of case, further case series or longitudinal studies of such cases may help understand better the pathomechanics related to spondylolisthesis at this level.

VMucoid Degeneration of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament: A Case Report and Review of Literature.
p914
aVMucoid degeneration of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a very rare cause of knee pain. Patient having mucoid degeneration of ACL seeks multiple orthopedic consultation and most of the time treating orthopedican miss its diagnosis either because of lack of experience or rare cause of pain unless doctor sought magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of knee.We report a case of mucoid degeneration of the ACL in a 50-year-old female with knee pain of 18 months duration. The patient presented with extension block of the knee. After arthroscopic debridement of the lesion, the patient regained full range of motion of the knee and were pain-free at follow-up.A long duration of non-specific knee pain in a patient should be evaluated with MRI. Mucoid degeneration of the ACL is suspected when an apparently thickened and ill-defined ligament with increased signal intensity on all sequences in MRI is identified in a patient with physically intact ligament and no obvious trauma history. Arthroscopic debridement of the mucoid degeneration of the ACL was safe and effective in the patient.

p917
aVBrodie's abscess of cuboid bone is one of the rarest diagnosis in children which most often is hematogenous in origin. Although Streptococcus pyogenes has been uncommonly implicated as causative organism in other bones, it is not yet reported in the cuboid.We report the case of 14-year-old boy who presented with a lytic lesion in the cuboid bone. It was preceded by a penetrating injury with a small iron nail. He was treated with simple curettage without the addition of bone graft. Frank pus present in the cavity in the cuboid bone grew S. pyogenes on bacterial culture. Symptoms resolved after 6 weeks of antibiotics, however, complete radiological healing was obtained after 9 months.Although very rare, S. pyogenes associated Brodie's abscess should strongly be suspected in a posttraumatic lytic lesion in the cuboid bone and bone grafting is not always required for bone healing even in presence of large pus-filled cavity.

VIsolated Proximal Fibular Stress Fracture In Osteoarthritis Knee Presenting As L5 Radiculopathy.
p920
aVIsolated proximal fibular stress fractures are rare and usually seen only in athletes and military recruits. Its occurrence with osteoarthritis of the knee is not documented. Diagnosis of stress fractures is not difficult, but they can mimic other pathologies at times.A 45-year-old male patient presented with pain and paresthesias in left lower thigh and leg. He was previously treated as L5 radiculopathy confirmed with lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). He received analgesics followed by nerve root blocks at another center. He was referred to our center for L4-5 root decompression. Due to atypical spine symptoms, leg radiographs and MRI was done, which showed isolated stress fracture of the left proximal fibula.We conclude that isolated stress fractures of the proximal fibula can present as L5 radiculopathy. A high level of suspicion is required for diagnosis. MRI is the investigation of choice when in doubt.

VA rare case report of Patellar Osteochondroma.
p923
aVOsteochondroma (OC) is the most common benign tumor of the skeleton. However, patellar OC is very rare. Only five case reports have been published yet and only 1 after the year 1972. OCs grow during childhood through adolescence, but usually growing ends when the epiphyseal plates close. In an adult, the growth of an OC suggests the diagnosis of malignant transformation to a chondrosarcoma. However, enlargement of a patellar OC reported as benign after skeletal maturity is present in literature.We report the clinical and radiologic findings of a patellar OC in a 50-year-old female, with a 3-year progression of swelling, not painful, well-defined margins, normal skin, and no neurovascular deficits or functional impairment. The tumor was surgically resected, and histopathological examination did not show malignancy. After 2 years of follow-up, the patient has no complaints and no signs of recurrence.Patellar OCsare extremely rare with only a few reports published. It should be kept in mind that benign OCs can show symptomatic growth in skeletally mature patients without malignant transformation.

VGanglion Cyst of Knee from Hoffa's Fat Pad Protruding Anterolaterally Through Retinacular Rent: A Case Report.
p926
aVIntra-articular ganglion cysts of the knee joint are rare occurrences. They are usually encountered as incidental findings in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or in arthroscopy. They may originate from both the cruciate ligaments and the menisci, from the popliteus tendon and alar folds, infrapatellar fat pad of Hoffa, and subchondral bone cysts. Those arising from the Hoffa's fat pad, usually present as palpable mass at anterior aspect of the knee joint. We report a case of intraarticular ganglion cyst of knee arising from the infrapatellar fat pad and protruding anterolaterally through retinacular rent into the subcutaneous plane.A 19-year-old young man, presented with a painless gradually increasing swelling at the anterior aspect of left knee of 9 months duration. MRI scan revealed a multilobulated, cyst with septations within the anterior aspect of the knee joint, just inferolateral to the patella, with deep extension into the infrapatellar fat pad, and superficial extension into the subcutaneous space across the retinaculum. After diagnostic arthroscopy, we performed an open excision of the cystic mass and confirmed the retinacular rent pre-operatively.Arthroscopic resection and debridement is the gold standard treatment in ganglion cyst of the knee. However, a subcutaneous extension may lead to incomplete arthroscopic resection: Leaving behind the residual tissue which may cause recurrence. Therefore, proper pre-operative evaluation of MR images of these cases is very important.

VPigmented Villonodular Synovitis Presenting as a Popliteal Cyst.
p929
aVPigmented villonodular synovitis is an uncommon disease characterized by hyperplastic synovium, large effusions and bone erosions. It commonly mimics other conditions. As a result, the diagnosis may remain elusive, as the classic signs of tenderness and effusion are not specific. Occasionally, PVNS presents as a popliteal cyst, which may divert attention from intra-articular pathology. In this article, we describe a case of pigmented villonodular synovitis that presented with a popliteal cyst as the chief problem.A twelve year old boy presented to us with a history of a gradually enlarging mass in the left popliteal fossa since eighteen months. He complained of restriction of terminal knee flexion, but he had no pain. After clinical examination and imaging the mass was interpreted as being either a popliteal cyst or chronic hematoma without ruling out the possibility of soft tissue sarcoma. An open excisional biopsy of the lesion was performed which revealed a reddish-brown cystic-nodular mass communicating with the knee joint. The histology was consistent with that of pigmented villonodular synovitis. We performed an arthroscopic synovectomy 3 weeks later. Abnormal synovium found in all compartments of the knee was removed. Histology from the intra-articular lesion was also consistent with a diagnosis of pigmented villonodular synovitis.A swelling in the popliteal region may be due to various etiologies. The cause should be thoroughly investigated. Along with clinical examination and imaging the tissue must be subjected to histopathological examination. Pigmented villonodular synovitis can rarely present as a popliteal cyst. In such a situation, treatment consists of dealing with intra-articular and extra-articular pathology.

VAre Two Surgeries Necessary for Correction of 1 Deformity- Cervical Kyphosis in Neurofibromatosis?- A Rare Case Report.
p932
aVDystrophic neurofibromatosis type I, involving upper cervical spines, is rare, which can cause serious complications. Myelopathy develops due to compression of the cord posteriorly. Surgical correction has its inherent risks and difficulties because of poor bone quality, difficult anterior approach because of bizarre deformities, and the necessary manipulation, which might cause more cord damage and ischemia. Anterior decompression with alignment correction was an early popular choice. But without posterior shortening, the technique proved unsatisfactory in restoring normal alignment. It tended to expose the graft bone at increased risk of insufficient union or extruding. So a combination of anterior decompression and posterior correction was generally recommended. This report describes surgical technique applicable to cases of severe cervical kyphosis using only anterior approach.A 13-year-old boy, a case of neurofibromatosis type 1 presented with neck pain, and bilateral upper limb radiculopathy for 2 months with affected daily living, with intact neurology. Imaging demonstrated 46° kyphosis (C3-C5), marked dystrophic changes of the C4 and C5, extreme dorsal angulation indenting the cord. Anterior surgery was planned for the patient with neuromonitoring. Through left anterior approach, total C3, C4 and C5 corpectomy was accomplished, keeping the PLL intact. The defect was filled with a fibular cortical graft which was stabilized with 48 mm cervical screw plate, showing full correction of kyphosis postoperatively. At the follow-up 6 months postoperatively, lateral plain radiograph showed stability of the cervical spine fusion without correction loss. The patient had full relief from tingling and numbness with no neurological deficit and could resume his daily duties. Patient is asymptomatic at 2 years follow up.Only anterior decompression and fusion are effective in satisfactorily correcting cervical kyphosis in cases of neurofibromatosis without neurologic compromise and avoids the risk of damage to vital neurovascular structures because of pedicle or lateral mass screw fixation.

VReconstruction of Mirror Foot with Dysplastic Tibia.
p935
aVThe Mirror foot is a rare congenital anomaly associated with duplication of the structures of the foot. Verghese et al have classified these feet into three types. Type three is associated with a Dysplastic tibia of which only 5 have been reported. Surgical management has been reported in only two of these five cases which are in the form of amputation.We would like to present the reconstruction of a Mirror foot associated with a dysplastic tibia. Our case which is only the sixth reported case attempts to present a surgical reconstruction to a plantigrade foot. Reconstruction was attempted in this case since the child showed a good quadriceps function at the knee. Reconstruction consisted of excision of the preaxial polydactyly to achieve a more cosmetic appearance to the foot as well as improve the ability to wear foot wear. The dysplastic tibia was osteotomized to correct the varus deformity and achieve a plantigtade foot. This helped the child to ambulate more easily with a shoe raise and a brace to maintain the correction achieved. At a five year follow up the child was walking and running with a shoe raise for a 9 cm limb length discrepancy. There was however recurrence of the deformity due to fibular overgrowth. The child's parents refused further reconstruction and were satisfied with the present function and appearance of the child.Reconstruction can therefore be attempted in these limbs associated with good quadriceps function.

VA Rare Case of Pubic Ramus Osteochondroma.
p938
aVOsteochondroma are benign neoplasms which arise from small cartilage nodules within the periosteum. They can be either pedunculated or sessile and are more common in the extremities. They rarely develop in bones like scapula, feet, hands and pelvis. Management of the lesion is by en-bloc excision.We present a case of 18 year female, who came with a swelling in right groin since 2 years which was diagnosed to be osteochondroma on x-ray and magnetic resonance imaging. Excision biopsy was done as the patient wanted it to be removed for cosmetic purpose and confirmed it to be non-malignant osteochondroma. There has been no recurrence even after 1 year of follow up.Thus osteochondroma of the pelvis should be kept in mind as a differential diagnosis when evaluating mass in pelvis. Also these have to be removed when they pose cosmetic problems.

VAn Unexpected Complication of Residual Fibular Strut Graft While Performing A Press fit Hemiarthroplasty for A Secondary Nonunion Fracture Neck of the Femur.
p941
aVPerioperative complications are well known during partial and total hip arthroplasty. One of the common categories of these complications is an intraoperative fractures of the proximal femur. Here we discuss a case of perforation of posteromedial cortex of the proximal femur, while doing a press fit modular bipolar hemiarthroplasty, in a young adult with secondary nonunion of the femoral neck fracture. The cause of this proximal femur perforation was residual fibular strut graft that, redirected the femoral stem into undesirable direction. This complication of residual fibular strut graft has not been disscussed much in the orthopedic literature previously.A press fit modular bipolar hiparthroplasty was performed in a young adult male with nonunion fracture neck of the femur secondary to initial fixation using 6.5mm cannulated hip screws and nonvascularized free fibular strut grafting. Failure to completely remove the fibular strut from the proximal femur lead to difficult negotiation of the femoral stem into the femoral canal and ultimately a perforation in the proximal femur at the level of the lesser trochanter. A revision procedure was done to completely remove the residual fibular graft, and then a fresh press fit modular bipolar hemiarthroplasty was done.Complete removal of fibular strut graft should be done, while performing hip arthroplasty in patients with failed fibular grafting for fracture neck of the femur.

VSingle Stage Treatment of Non - Union of Transcervical Neck Femur Fracture with Shepherd Crook Deformity of Proximal Femur in A Case of Fibrous Dysplasia using Dynamic Hip Screw Fixation.
p944
aVFibrous dysplasia is a rare benign disorder of the skeletal system characterized by fibro osseous proliferation with intervening areas of normal or immature bone in the intramedullary region. It can either be a monostotic (involves one bone) or a polyostotic (involves more than one bone) presentation and usually occurs equally in males and females. Deformities like scoliosis and shepherd's crook deformity are frequently encountered in the polyostotic form. We report a rare managed case of bilateral non-union of the pathological fracture of femur neck with shepherd's crook deformity of the proximal femur in a case of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia.A 16 years old female case of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia had bilateral Shepherd's crook deformity of the proximal femur with bilateral non - union of pathological fracture of neck femur. We managed each side in one stage with two osteotomies. On the right side, first oblique osteotomy was done from just distal to the greater trochanter up to the level of the neck and the second; lateral closing wedge abduction osteotomy was done at the subtrochanteric level. 2 months later on the left side double lateral closing wedge abduction osteotomies were performed both at the subtrochanteric level. Fixation of both the sides was done using a 135° Dynamic Richard's screw with a long side plate to span the osteotomy sites and the lesion. Post - operatively we achieved a neck shaft angle of 135° on right side and 133° on the left side. Follow up imaging showed union at both the osteotomy sites bilaterally and also at the site of the pathological fracture of neck femur. Presently, at 18 months post - operatively, patient is walking full weight bearing without support and there are no signs of recurrence of lesions of fibrous dysplasia or the deformity.Double osteotomy is an easy and effective method to correct the shepherd's crook deformity and achieve correct mechanical alignment. Dynamic hip screw with long side plate is a versatile implant to tackle the proximal femur deformity. Double osteotomy corrects the deformity and tackles the associated problems like non - union of the pathological neck femur fracture in one stage.

The features of this disorder include bony abnormalities, severe mental retardation, joint contractures, cataract and recurrent respiratory infections and breathing problems. Seizures and Distinctive facial features including prominent forehead, depressed nasal bridge and small nose is also associated with this pathology. Being rare, this is very difficult to diagnose when presented at OPD. Proper history and meticulous examination is extremely necessary. Our aim is to discuss current knowledge on etiopathogenesis as well as radiological and clinical symptoms of diseases associated with RCDP.5 yrs old male child presented with chest infection and periarticular swelling of all the small and large joints. The patient was walking with limp. History elicited that the child was born of a consanguineous marriage. The child was delivered at home. Birth weight was 2.4 kgs. He repeatedly had upper respiratory tract infections and was taking treatment for the same. He was further investigated in the form of clinical, biochemical and radiological assessment which stated that the patient was suffering from RCDP.This is a rare presentation. Though this is not curable, management of RCDP is symptomatic and supportive and may include physiotherapy and orthopedic procedures (in later stages) to improve function. The child may also undergo cataract surgery to improve vision.

VEasy and Inexpensive Technique for Removal of Round Headed, Jammed Locking Screws in Distal Tibial Interlocking Plate.
p950
aVThe advent of locking plates has brought new problems in implant removal. Difficulty in removing screws from a locking plate is well-known. These difficulties include cold welding between the screw head and locking screw hole, stripping of the recess of the screw head for the screwdriver, and cross-threading between threads in the screw head and screw hole. However, there are cases in which removal is difficult. We describe a new technique for removing a round headed, jammed locking screws from a locking plate.55 years old male patient received a locking distal tibial plate along with distal fibular plate 3years back from UAE. Now patient came with complaint of non-healing ulcer over medial aspect of lower 1/3rd of right leg from past 1 year. Non operative management did not improve the symptoms. The patient consented to implant removal, with the express understanding that implant removal might be impossible because already one failed attempt had been performed at some other hospital six months back. We then decided to proceed with the new technique. The rest of the proximal screws were removed using a technique not previously described. We used stainless steel metal cutting blades that are used to cut door locks or pad locks to cut the remaining stripped headed screws.This technique is very quick, easy to perform and inexpensive because the metal cutting blades which are used to cut the screws are very cheap. Yet it is very effective technique to remove the stripped headed or jammed locking screws. It is also very less destructive because of very less heat production during the procedure there is no problem of thermal necrosis to the bone or the surrounding soft tissue.

p953
aVDiaphyseal fractures of both bones of the forearm are commonly encountered in clinical practice. Segmental radius shaft fractures are, however, less commonly seen. We hereby report two cases of segmental complex radius fracture with mid-shaft ulna fracture. Such type of cases are reported previously in children but rarely in adults.In case-1, comminuted radius shaft fracture was fixed with square nails and ulna was fixed with Recon plate. In case-2, plating was done for radius mid-shaft, K-wiring for distal radius, and ulna was stabilized with a square nail. Details of both cases aredescribed and alternative management options are discussed.To the best of our knowledge, a segmental fracture of the radius associated with ipsilateral mid-shaft fracture of the ulna in an adult has been rarely reported in the literature to date. Optimal management of such fracture configuration has not been outlined in the literature. Prompt surgical management of such a complex fracture resulted in a rapid, full and satisfactory functional recovery for our patient.

aVMyositis ossificans circumscripta is a benign non neoplastic ossifying tumor presenting with bone like osteoid tissue extraskelletaly amidst the muscle planes. This condition when not associated with trauma is very trivial and considering the way it mimics certain characteristics, it may be misunderstood as a malignant neoplasm, abscess or antibioma. The aetiology of this atraumatic condition is still indistinct and remains a question unsolved. We would like to report such a case with distinctly unusual presentation that occurred in our institute. Thereby help in understanding the characteristics of the tumor and associated problems in the diagnoses and treatment.We report a case of 18 year old male presenting with acute onset severe pain in right gluteal region and associated swelling with no history of trauma. All possible investigations including haematological work up, Radiographs, Ultrasonography, aspiration and Magnetic resonance imaging proved to be inconclusive. Open excision and histopathology revealed the condition as myositis ossificans.Our report is aimed towards understanding the difficulty in diagnosing atraumatic myositis ossificans circumscripta and aid in understanding the possible aetiology of unusual presentation without history of trauma.

aVIn females, raising a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is challenging and primary closure of flap donor site causes breast deformity with medial displacement of nipple areola complex. To avoid this distortion, a new method of donor site closure is devised.A parasternal skin paddle which has better vascularity is planned while doing a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap in females and a lateral flap planned along the lateral breast curve is used to cover the donor site. The lateral flap donor site is primarily closed. This prevents medial displacement of nipple areola complex.A total of 47 patients underwent donor site flap closure technique. Minor complications in form of marginal necrosis near the tip of the flap were observed in 10.6 % patients. The donor breast of all these PMMC flaps had good contour and aesthetic positioning of nipple areola complex.Donor site morbidity with respect to breast distortion has not been studied so far in case of females so our study stands unique in this aspect. Using this technique of planning PMMC in females ensures a skin paddle of better vascularity and restores the breast aesthetics.

VDual-Source Computed Tomography for Chronic Total Occlusion of Coronary Arteries.
p964
aVWe compared dual-source CT (DSCT) and conventional angiography (CA) in evaluation of chronic total occlusion (CTO) of coronary arteries.Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in CTO is technically difficult and has comparatively lower success rate than intervention in non-occluded artery. Accurate assessment of lesion morphology is an important determinant of PCI success in CTO.Nineteen symptomatic patients (18 men, age: 58.6\u2009±\u200910.6 years) with a CTO on CA were subjected to a DSCT (Definition, Siemens, Germany). Heart rate (HR) control was not performed. Dedicated post-processing software was used for lesion analysis on both modalities. Presence of bridging collaterals, stump morphology, calcification, side branch, proximal tortuosity, occlusion length, distal vessel interpretability, and distal lesions were statistically compared.There were 20 CTOs. HR during DSCT ranged from 53 to 131 bpm. Bridging collaterals were seen in 3/20 (15%) lesions on CA and in none on DSCT. Stump anatomy and side branch were identified equally well. Plaque calcification was identified in 5/20 (25%) lesions on CA and in 12/20 (60%) lesions on DSCT (P\u2009=\u20090.025). Nature and extent of calcification were better visualized on DSCT. No proximal tortuosity was noted. Distal vessel was better interpretable on DSCT (15/20; 75%) compared to CA (9/20; 45%) (P\u2009=\u20090.05). No significant difference in lesion length was noted.DSCT performs as well as CA for most features of CTO. Avoidance of need to control HR, ability to better detect and characterize calcium and to interpret distal vessels make it a useful pre-intervention investigation. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

aVIn response to recent outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Gujarat (India). This investigation was carried out in order to determine the risk of CCHF. The prevalence and abundance of Hyalomma (Acari: Ixodidae) were recorded on the domestic animals in the Union territory of Dadra & Nagar Haveli during the period of January to December 2012. Overall, 71 larva and 148 adults belonging to three species of Hyalomma viz., Hyal. anatolicum anatolicum, Hyal. detritum, and Hyal. marginatum isaaci were collected from 33 infested domestic mammals (Goats, Cows, Buffalos, Dogs and Cats). The infestation of Hyal. a. anatolicum and Hyal. m. isaaci (incriminated as the vector of CCHF virus) on cattles in these area may serious implication for human health, considering the fact that these ticks serve as vectors of CCHF. To minimize these dangers, strategic surveillance and control methods could be useful in the control of ticks recorded during the survey.

aVMicrofilariae and adult filarial worm have been incidentally detected in fine needle aspirates of various lesions in clinically unsuspected cases. Here we report a male patient who presented with a tender breast nodule and single enlarged lymph node. Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) yielded 1 ml of yellow coloured fluid and single thread like worm measuring 6 × 0.2 cm. A diagnosis of breast abscess with a worm morphologically consistent with filariasis was offered. A follow up visit after 2 months showed regression of the breast lesion and the lymph node. Filariasis of the breast is an uncommon condition and can cause a diagnostic dilemma at times. FNA cytology appears to be a more convenient and effective diagnostic tool in patients with mass lesions. Demonstration and identification of the parasite in smears helps in avoiding surgical excision and early institution of prompt therapy especially in young patients.

The present study was carried out to determine the morphological characteristics of Cysticercus cellulosae, so as to differentiate the C. viscerotropica (larval form of T. asiatica) which is having only rudimentary hooks on their rostellum. Morphological analysis was conducted on 22 Cysticercus positive samples. Measurements for number of hooks (large and small), the total length and blade length of large and small hooks per rostellum were carried out as per previous studies. Microscopic examination of all the cysts showed typical characteristic of T. solium i.e. presence of hooks in all the cysts. The results indicated absence of T. asiatica from naturally infected pigs in Punjab (India).

VA review on the strategies for oral delivery of proteins and peptides and their clinical perspectives.
p978
aVIn the modern world, a number of therapeutic proteins such as vaccines, antigens, and hormones are being developed utilizing different sophisticated biotechnological techniques like recombinant DNA technology and protein purification. However, the major glitches in the optimal utilization of therapeutic proteins and peptides by the oral route are their extensive hepatic first-pass metabolism, degradation in the gastrointestinal tract (presence of enzymes and pH-dependent factors), large molecular size and poor permeation. These problems can be overcome by adopting techniques such as chemical transformation of protein structures, enzyme inhibitors, mucoadhesive polymers and permeation enhancers. Being invasive, parenteral route is inconvenient for the administration of protein and peptides, several research endeavors have been undertaken to formulate a better delivery system for proteins and peptides with major emphasis on non-invasive routes such as oral, transdermal, vaginal, rectal, pulmonary and intrauterine. This review article emphasizes on the recent advancements made in the delivery of protein and peptides by a non-invasive (peroral) route into the body.

aVDespite single handily causing significant deleterious effects on the health and production of small ruminants, trichurid infections are still amongst the underreported diseases in the Indian context. The present study deals with the season wise prevalence of Trichuris sp. in small ruminants from Mathura region India. An overall prevalence of 8.73 % in sheep and 13.65 % in goats was found in the instant study. Highest prevalence were recorded in rainy season (11.03 and 16.84 %) followed by summer (8.12 and 13.06 %) and winter season (6.91 and 11.39 %) in sheep and goats, respectively. So far as age wise prevalence is concerned, young sheep and goat (<6 months of age) were found to more affected than their adult (>6 months) counterparts. Again considering the sex wise prevalence rates, female animals were found more affected than male counterparts regardless of both the species. Finally, the contributing factors, trends in variations of parasitism and comparison with available literature has been described. The study has generated some vital data about this under reported parasitic entity.

aVCutaneous lesions in human patient due to the bite of rat mite Ornithonyssus bacoti are frequently misdiagnosed as allergies, fungal infection, or bacterial infection. Bite lesions in the personnel working in a Laboratory Animal facility which was infested with O. bacoti is reported here along with its therapeutic management. Diagnosis of the parasites obtained from the clothing of the personnel and later from the infested mice colony was based on preliminary light microscopy and confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. The mean length and breadth of adult female mite were 1.13 mm × 0.63 mm. The body is hairy, unsegmented and has four pairs of legs. The gnathostoma has long pointed chelicerae and pedipalp. The dorsal surface has one dorsal shield, and the ventral surface has three shields- sternal, genital and anal shield. Treatment of dermatitis involved antihistaminic drugs for a period of 3-5 days. The skin lesion, characterized by papular erythema, tends to disappear within a period of 4-5 days of antihistaminic treatment. In untreated cases, the lesions disappeared within 7-10 days. Tropical rat mite O. bacoti Hirst, 1931 was identified to be the cause of infestation in the laboratory mice colony of Pasteur Institute of India, Coonoor, Tamil Nadu, predisposing the animal handlers to be temporary host.

VRandomised Prospective Controlled Trial of Topical 2 % Diltiazem Versus Lateral Internal Sphincterotomy for the Treatment of Chronic Fissure in Ano.
p1005
aVFissure in ano is a very common disorder of the anorectal region. Internal sphincter hypertonia with decreased relaxation coupled with mucosal ischemia of posterior anal canal are the major pathologies in chronic anal fissure (CAF). Though lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS) remains the gold standard of treatment for the disease, it is accompanied by the potential complication of incontinence to both flatus and faecal matter. The aim of our study was to explore the role of topical diltiazem as an effective and a safe alternative to sphincterotomy for chronic anal fissure. Ninety patients with CAF were randomly assigned to group A and group B, with 45 patients each. Group A patients received 2 % diltiazem topical application, twice daily, and group B patients underwent LIS. All the patients were reviewed at first, fourth and sixth week after initiation of treatment. Visual analogue scores for pain and healing of fissure by visual inspection were recorded and compared. In group A, 71 % had complete healing of fissure at 6 weeks, with fair amount of pain relief (mean VAS-3.38), and in group B, 96 % showed healing of fissure, with excellent pain relief (mean VAS-1.87). Headache and flushing were noted in two patients in group A while no patients in group B developed incontinence. We conclude that LIS is more effective than topical diltiazem in the treatment of CAF. Topical diltiazem may be employed as an initial conservative treatment option before considering the surgical alternative.

VA Technique for Localizing Perforated Duodenal Ulcer During Laparoscopic Repair.
p1008
aVLaparoscopic repair of duodenal ulcer perforation has certain advantages over open repair. However, the conversion rate to open surgery is still high. The most common reason for conversion is inadequate localization of the ulcer perforation site during laparoscopy. Here, a technique is described which will aid in localizing the perforation, make suturing and repair easier, and helps in checking the integrity of the repair at the end of the procedure. This is done by compressing the gall bladder with an instrument like a laparoscopic fan retractor and simultaneously depressing the first part of the duodenum with another instrument. This results in bile flowing out through the perforation and simultaneously depressing the duodenum downward, making it more easily visible and making identification easier. Suturing is easier due to the liver also getting retracted simultaneously and more space being available consequently. Integrity of the anastomoses is also easily ascertained by this maneuver.

aVElevated skull fractures form a rare subset of compound skull fractures. Owing to the paucity of cases studied and reported, these fractures still remain an under-recognized entity. We attempt to highlight the incidence of these relatively rare presentations of head injury. We had prospectively studied eight cases of elevated skull fractures in a mixed population of adults (five patients) and pediatric age group (three patients). Patients were evaluated in terms of clinical presentation, mode and mechanism of injury, treatment options, and final outcome, highlighting the appropriate management strategies taken in each case. The injury in these patients was due to tangential impact of a heavy object or assault weapon. Compounding of the fracture externally and dural tears was an inconstant feature. Associated intracranial injuries were cerebral contusions and extradural hematomas. An initial conservative therapy was given to all pediatric patients while adult patients underwent explorative craniectomy and evacuation of hematoma. Although an unusual presentation of skull fractures, elevated skull fractures warrant an early diagnosis, careful clinical evaluation, and prompt surgical therapy (whenever needed) for a successful outcome.

VNo Scalpel Vasectomy (NSV) with Ligation and Excision: A Single Centre Experience.
p1021
aVNo scalpel vasectomy (NSV) has proved to be a safe and simple procedure for permanent sterilization for men. Ligation and excision of the vas deferens followed by fascial interposition is the procedure of choice. It is believed that vas excision without fascial interposition has a risk of failure. The objective of this study was to evaluate the technique of NSV with ligation and excision only. No scalpel vasectomy performed in an urban centre was taken for this prospective study. Only ligation and excision procedure was applied in its execution. It was demonstrated and performed under the supervision of an expert. Information regarding early and late complications including failure was gathered. A total number of 3,392 NSVs were performed in an urban training centre between Apr' 2009 to Mar' 2013. The procedure applied was only excision and ligation of the vas deferens. The fascial interposition was not included in the procedure. Haematoma (1), bleeding (3), foreign body granuloma (1), scrotal pain (3), epididymitis (1) and sinus formations (1) were encountered. There was only one failure in the whole group of acceptors. NSV with ligation and excision is a simple and easy procedure to learn and perform. Complications and failures are negligible. The additional fascial interposition needs more surgical skill and is time-consuming, hence can be avoided where a large number of acceptors need to undergo NSV in a rural camp.

The samples from each bottle were sent for culture on the 3rd, 5th, and 7th day. All the culture reports were analyzed and statistically compared. A total of 2,160 samples were sent for culture from solutions including control over a period of 7 days. A total of 360 samples were sent for culture from each antiseptic solution. Out of 2,160 samples, 240 (11.11 %) were positive over a period of 7 days for contamination with microbial organisms. The most common organism isolated was Pseudomonas present in 140 samples followed by E. coli in 71 samples. S. aureus was present in seven samples, bacillus in ten samples, and Coaglase -ve Streptococcus and Klebsiella in six samples each. Number of positive culture consistently increased in normal saline and cetrimide/chlorhexidine, but povidone iodine, chloroxylenol, and glutaraldehyde did not show any positive culture on the 3rd day. Povidone iodine and glutaraldehyde showed positive culture on the 5th and 7th day, respectively., but they were statistically insignificant. On the 7th day, glutaraldehyde was the only solution which did not show any positive culture. We strongly recommend that the Cheattle's forceps should be kept in a bottle containing glutaraldehyde or chloroxylenol.

aVPlasma procalcitonin (PCT) is a highly specific marker for the diagnosis of bacterial infection and sepsis. Studies have demonstrated its role in the setting of sepsis and acute pancreatitis. This study aims to analyze and compare the prognostic efficacy of plasma procalcitonin strip test in acute pancreatitis. A prospective study was conducted in the department of general surgery from June 2012 to June 2013. Plasma procalcitonin was estimated by the semiquantitative strip test. The study included a total of 50 patients diagnosed to have acute pancreatitis. Data was collected and statistically analyzed using SPSS version 17. Thirty-nine out of the 50 patients (78 %) were males with a mean age of 46.8 years (range, 25-78 years) and 25 patients (50 %) had ethanol-induced pancreatitis, while 13 patients (26 %) had gall stone pancreatitis. Plasma PCT values were found to correlate better than CRP levels and total leukocyte count with the total duration of hospitalization, ITU, and ICU stay, as well as with the progression to severe acute pancreatitis. A cut off for plasma PCT of >2 ng/mL was found to be 100 % sensitive and 100 % specific and a cut off for CRP of >19 mg/dL was 70 % sensitive and 65 % specific for predicting the progression to severe acute pancreatitis. Plasma PCT also correlated well with antibiotic requirement. A cut off value of >0.5 ng/mL for plasma PCT was 100 % sensitive and 80 % specific and a cut off value of >18 mg/dL for CRP was 86 % sensitive and 63 % specific for predicting antibiotic requirement. Plasma procalcitonin is an early and reliable prognostic indicator in acute pancreatitis. The procalcitonin strip test is a rapid test which is useful in analyzing prognosis in patients with acute pancreatitis.

Our objective was to compare the scores given by student-judges and faculty-judges for scientific presentations using the standardized score sheet. An objective, structured score-sheet was designed using existing literature. Five presentations, all made using PowerPoint, were judged using the structured score-sheet by seven student-judges and two-faculty judges. The mean score of all the score-sheets (n\u2009=\u200945) was 38.5\u2009+\u20095.4 (out of a maximum score of 50). There was no statistical difference between mean scores assigned by students or faculty (p\u2009=\u20090.2). Thus, an objective, structured score sheet like ours, when used to judge scientific presentations, gave uniform results even when judges hailed from different levels of the medical hierarchy.

aVGroundwater pollution due to anthropogenic activities is one of the major environmental problems in urban and industrial areas. The present study demonstrates the integrated approach with GIS and DRASTIC model to derive a groundwater vulnerability to pollution map. The model considers the seven hydrogeological factors [Depth to water table (D), net recharge (R), aquifer media (A), soil media (S), topography or slope (T), impact of vadose zone (I) and hydraulic Conductivity(C)] for generating the groundwater vulnerability to pollution map. The model was applied for assessing the groundwater vulnerability to pollution in Ranchi district, Jharkhand, India. The model was validated by comparing the model output (vulnerability indices) with the observed nitrate concentrations in groundwater in the study area. The reason behind the selection of nitrate is that the major sources of nitrate in groundwater are anthropogenic in nature. Groundwater samples were collected from 30 wells/tube wells distributed in the study area. The samples were analyzed in the laboratory for measuring the nitrate concentrations in groundwater. A sensitivity analysis of the integrated model was performed to evaluate the influence of single parameters on groundwater vulnerability index. New weights were computed for each input parameters to understand the influence of individual hydrogeological factors in vulnerability indices in the study area. Aquifer vulnerability maps generated in this study can be used for environmental planning and groundwater management.

VA ChIP-on-chip tiling array approach detects functional histone-free regions associated with boundaries at vertebrate HOX genes.
p1044
aVHox genes impart segment identity to body structures along the anterior-posterior axis and are crucial for proper development. A unique feature of the Hox loci is the collinearity between the gene position within the cluster and its spatial expression pattern along the body axis. However, the mechanisms that regulate collinear patterns of Hox gene expression remain unclear, especially in higher vertebrates. We recently identified novel histone-free regions (HFRs) that can act as chromatin boundary elements demarcating successive murine Hox genes and help regulate their precise expression domains (Srivastava et al., 2013). In this report, we describe in detail the ChIP-chip analysis strategy associated with the identification of these HFRs. We also provide the Perl scripts for HFR extraction and quality control analysis for this custom designed tiling array dataset.

p1047
aVGST family genes have a critical role in xenobiotic metabolism and drug resistance. Among the GST family the GST-\u03bc, GST-\u03c0, GST-\u03b1 and GST-\u03b8 are the most abundant classes and have a major role in the carcinogen detoxification process. Nevertheless the activity of these enzymes may differ due to polymorphisms which ultimately results in interindividual susceptibility to cancer development. In this work, we have analyzed the potentially deleterious nsSNPs that can alter the function of these genes. As a result among the nsSNPs, 101 (42.61%) were found to be deleterious by a sequence homology-based tool, 67 (28.27%) by a structure homology based tool and a total of 59 (24.89%) by both. We propose a modeled structure of the five highly deleterious mutant proteins. Our results will provide useful information in selecting target SNPs that are likely to have an impact on GST activity and contribute to an individual's susceptibility to the disease.

The aim was to evaluate the results of type 1 interlay tympanoplasty with respect to graft uptake, hearing improvement and complications. Total of 100 cases with a mucosal type of chronic suppurative otitis media and a large central perforation (involving more than 50 % of tympanic membrane) were operated for type 1 tympanoplasty where the graft was placed by interlay method (below the fibro-squamous layer and above the mucosal or endothelial layer). Patients were followed up with ear microscopy at each follow up visit and an audiometry at the end of 3rd month. Statistical analysis was done by statcal software using paired t test and two sample t test for proportion. 96 (96 %) cases had a successful graft uptake. The mean pre-operative air-bone gap was 36.42 ± 12.0 dB; whereas the mean post-operative air-bone gap was 9.7 ± 6.71 dB. Except for residual perforation in four patients and partial tympanomeatal flap necrosis in two patients no other complications were encountered. Thus, we conclude that, the interlay tympanoplasty is a safe and effective method of graft placement for large central perforation.

Procedure related pleural tear occurred in 3 patients during harvesting of the rib which were repaired intra-operatively with no post-operative complications. There were 2 failures in our series, in the rest 15 patients the flap had taken up; have good oral continence taking semi-solid diet and have satisfactory cosmetic appearance. This study shows that 5th rib osteo-pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is a quick, easy to learn, one stage reconstructive procedure with a good predictable cosmetic and functional outcomes.

VRole of Laryngeal Electromyography in Predicting Recovery After Vocal Fold Paralysis.
p1061
aVAccurate prognostication of the outcome of vocal fold immobility assumes great importance in the management. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic efficacy of Laryngeal electromyography in cases of vocal fold immobility. A nonrandomized prospective study was carried out from Sep 2009 to Jun 2011. Patients were evaluated using Fiberoptic laryngoscopy and Laryngeal electromyography over a period of 24 weeks. 51 subjects participated in the study, comprised of 22 males and 29 females. All patients underwent detailed clinical examination including Fiberoptic laryngoscopy on the first visit and Laryngeal electromyography testing on the second visit. Subsequent neuromonitoring was carried out at 04, 12 and 24 weeks from date of initial recording. Outcome measures of vocal fold motion were dichotomized into persistent vocal fold immobility (unilateral or bilateral) or resolved vocal fold motion (normal). Approximately 24 weeks after onset of palsy, mobility of the paralyzed vocal cord was restored in 31 (60.78 %) of 51 cases, while 20 (39.22 %) remained immobile. Sensitivity of laryngeal electromyography was 92.53 % ; specificity 93.33 %, positive predictive value 98.77 % and negative predictive value 68.29 %. This study confirmed the utility of Laryngeal electromyography in predicting prognosis for recovery of vocal fold motion after laryngeal nerve injury. The results supported the hypothesis that Laryngeal electromyography data can be used effectively to determine a prognosis for recovery of vocal fold motion.

aVSaturated fat and trans fat consumption is linked to cardiovascular disease. Considering the health implications of saturated and trans fats investigation was undertaken with the objective to study the fat compositions in biscuits sold in Indian market. These commercial biscuits were analysed for saturated and trans fatty acids using capillary GC. The results of analysis of 46 biscuit samples showed that the total fat content ranged from 9.5 to 25.0 g/100 g of biscuits. The fatty acid profile showed that, saturated fat content in biscuits ranged from 5.1 to 18.7 g/100 g. The overall range of total trans fat content was found to be 0.1 to 3.2 g/100 g biscuit and cis monounsaturated fatty acid content varied from 0.9 to 8.6 g/100 g of biscuits. The low-level trans fatty acid was mainly by dienes and trienes where as high-level trans was from monoenes of C18. Polyunsaturated fatty acids in biscuits ranged from 0.2 to 3.5 g/100 g. Biscuits of same brand on repeat analysis over a period of one year showed little variation in fat, saturated and trans fat content.

p1069
aVTo evaluates the role of measuring intraocular pressure (IOP) outside office-hour in primary adult onset glaucoma.This retrospective study included 100 cases of primary adult onset glaucoma. IOP readings obtained with Goldmann applanation tonometry between 7 am and 10 pm were compared to office-hour readings.One hundred patients were enrolled (mean age: 58.64 ± 10.98 years) in the study. Overall, mean diurnal IOP was significantly higher than mean office IOP (p < 0.05). Two-thirds of the patients had peak IOP measurements outside office-hour. Mean diurnal IOP fluctuation (7.03 ± 2.69 mm Hg) was significantly higher than mean office IOP fluctuation (4.31 ± 2.6 mm Hg) (p < 0.003). There was a significant correlation between baseline IOP and fluctuation in IOP (r = 0.61, p<0.001).The mean diurnal IOP and IOP fluctuations were higher than office-hour readings in patients with primary adult onset glaucoma. Diurnal monitoring may be particularly useful in patients with high baseline IOP.

VStability-Indicating RP-HPLC Method for the Determination of Ambrisentan and Tadalafil in Pharmaceutical Dosage Form.
p1072
aVA simple, rapid, and highly selective RP-HPLC method was developed for the simultaneous determination of Ambrisentan (AMB) and Tadalafil (TADA) drug substances in the fixed dosage strength of 10 mg and 40 mg, respectively. Effective chromatographic separation was achieved using a Hypersil GOLD C18 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm internal diameter, 5 \u03bcm particle size) with a mobile phase composed of methanol, water, and acetonitrile in the ratio of 40:40:20 (by volume). The mobile phase was pumped using a gradient HPLC system at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, and quantification of the analytes was based on measuring their peak areas at 260 nm. The retention times for Ambrisentan and Tadalafil were about 2.80 and 7.10 min, respectively. The reliability and analytical performance of the proposed HPLC procedure were statistically validated with respect to system suitability, linearity, ranges, precision, accuracy, specificity, robustness, detection, and quantification limits. Calibration curves were linear in the ranges of 1-20 \u03bcg/mL for Ambrisentan and 4-80 \u03bcg/mL for Tadalafil with correlation coefficients >0.990. The proposed method proved to be selective and stability-indicating by the resolution of the two analytes from the forced degradation (hydrolysis, oxidation, and photolysis) products. The validated HPLC method was successfully applied to the analysis of AMB and TADA in pharmaceutical dosage form.

aVTo compare the clinical results of three techniques of hysterectomy- abdominal hysterectomy (AH), non-descent vaginal hysterectomy (NDVH), and laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH).A simple prospective randomized study was performed in a tertiary care centre between June 2011 and Dec 2012, among 150 consecutive women indicated to undergo hysterectomy for benign and mobile uterine conditions. They were randomly assigned 50 each to three routes of hysterectomy; (abdominal, vaginal, and laparoscopic-assisted vaginal). Outcome measures including operating time, blood loss, rate of complications, consumption of analgesics, and length of hospital stay were assessed and compared between groups.As far as duration of operation, mean blood loss, analgesic requirement, length of hospital stay, P value was significant. Incidence of complications is least among VH group.Vaginal hysterectomy is the gold standard in the era of minimal access surgery. Some of the contraindications to VH can be overcome by assistance of laparoscope and a potential abdominal hysterectomy can be converted to a vaginal procedure.

p1089
aVEarly diagnosis of sepsis in alcoholic hepatitis is important for selecting the appropriate therapy. The role of procalcitonin (PCT) to diagnose sepsis in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is not yet clear.All patients admitted with alcoholic hepatitis and SIRS underwent measurement of serum PCT and C reactive protein (CRP) levels within 24 h of admission. Patients were classified into two groups: group 1, alcoholic hepatitis with SIRS alone; group 2, alcoholic hepatitis with SIRS and sepsis. The ability of PCT to predict sepsis was evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses to compare the two groups.The study included 11 patients in group 1 and 29 in group 2. All were male (median age 42 years; range, 24-65 years). Age, dose and duration of alcohol intake, biochemical parameters and median MELD score were not significantly different between the two groups. PCT and CRP were significantly higher among group 2 than group 1 patients (p < 0.05). ROC analysis showed an AUC of 0.81 (95 % CI 0.66-0.96) and 0.83 (95 % CI 0.68-0.93) for PCT and CRP, respectively, in distinguishing sepsis from SIRS without sepsis. A cutoff level of 0.57 mcg/l for PCT (sensitivity 79 %, specificity 82 %) for diagnosing sepsis in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and SIRS was comparable to a serum CRP cutoff level of 2.3 mg/dl (sensitivity 82.0 %, specificity 75 %).Serum PCT can be a useful marker for diagnosing sepsis in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and SIRS and compares favorably with serum CRP levels.

p1092
aVCirculating tumor cells (CTC) and cancer stem cells (CSC) have been proposed as tools for detection and characterization of disease and individualization of therapy in patients with many solid tumors. Several automated and semi-automated techniques for identification and isolation of these cells from blood have been proposed and reviewed mostly focusing on their feasibility. In this mini review we summarize the recent relevant literature on this topic and discuss the clinical usability of measuring CTC and CSC in peripheral blood in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Besides literature, the basis for this evaluation was the authors' experience with treating HCC and research experience on CSC and CTC. Few original reports and reviews have been published focusing on CTC and CSC in HCC. Though HCC is one of the five most common malignancies worldwide only recently these cells have come into focus for detection and characterization of this disease that is characterized by high plasticity and malignancy. A focused and prospective validation of the clinical usability of detecting these cells in HCC is still needed, but results seem promising that they may add great benefit for early detection and individualization of therapy.

VEvaluation of Effect of Astringent on Oral Mucosa as a Non-surgical Preprosthetic Treatment Modality in Edentulous Patients: An In Vivo Study.
p1107
aVPreprosthetic treatments are advocated in edentulous patients to enhance the denture bearing areas for good denture support. Most of the times the preprosthetic treatments are considered only in a surgical way. Ideally every edentulous patient undergoing complete denture treatment needs a non-surgical preprosthetic treatment. So that, the denture bearing area will be properly prepared before the denture construction. The present study was conducted on thirty completely edentulous male patients who had visited to our Institute for the treatment. Each patient was asked to massage with astringent gel on the denture bearing mucosa over a 4 weeks period. Exfoliative cytology was used to collect the surface cells from the palatal mucosa. First scrape was taken before the stimulation treatment was started. The second and third scrape was taken after the stimulation treatment with astringent gel for each patient. In this way total 90 scrapes were made and the each smear was stained with the Papanicolaou's technique to examine under light microscope. About 100 cells were counted from each stained smear. The number of parabasal cells, intermediate cells and superficial cells were recorded to calculate the degree of keratinization. Statistical analysis was performed. A significant difference (p < 0.001) in keratinization levels was found. The mean percentage of superficial cells before the stimulation treatment was 79.80 %; this percentage was gradually increased to 84.60 and 90.57 % after the 2  and 4 weeks period of stimulation treatment respectively with astringent gel.

VPostural Assessment of Students Evaluating the Need of Ergonomic Seat and Magnification in Dentistry.
p1113
aVDental students using conventional chairs need immediate change in their posture. Implementing an ergonomic posture is necessary as they are at high risk for developing musculoskeletal disorders. This study recommends the use of an ergonomic seat and magnification system to enhance the visibility and the posture of an operator. The aim of this study is to make a foray into the hazards caused by inappropriate posture of dental students while working. It also aims at creating a cognizance about the related health implications among the dental fraternity at large, and to understand the significance of adopting an ergonomic posture since the beginning of the professional course. In the present study, postures have been assessed by using rapid upper limb assessment (RULA). This method uses diagrams of body postures and three scoring tables to evaluate ones exposure to risk factors. Ninety students from II BDS (preclinical students in the second year of dental school) were assessed in three groups using three different seats with and without magnification system. The results recorded significantly higher RULA scores for the conventional seats without using the magnification system compared to the SSC (Salli Saddle Chair-an ergonomic seat) with the use of magnification system. A poor ergonomic posture can make the dental students get habituated to the wrong working style which might lead to MSDs (Musculoskeletal diseases). It is advisable to acclimatize to good habits at the inception of the course, to prevent MSDs later in life.

aVA novel stability-indicating RP-HPLC method was developed for the simultaneous estimation of clindamycin phosphate (hydrophilic), adapalene (hydro-phobic), phenoxyethanol, and methylparaben in topical gel formulations. Optimum chromatographic separation among the analytes and stress-induced degradants peaks was achieved on the XBridge C18 (50 × 4.6 mm, 3.5 µm) column using a mobile phase consisting of a variable mixture of pH 2.50 ammonium hydrogen phosphate buffer, acetonitrile, and tetrahydrofuran with gradient elution. Detection was performed at 210 nm for phenoxyethanol, methylparaben, and clindamycin phosphate and 321 nm for adapalene. The method was optimized with a unique diluent selection for the extraction of clindamycin phosphate and adapalene from the gel matrix. The developed method was validated for method precision, specificity, LOD and LOQ, linearity, accuracy, robustness, and solution stability as per ICH guidelines. The proposed method can be employed for the quantification of clindamycin phosphate, adapalene, phenoxyethanol, and methylparaben in commercial topical gel formulations.

Chromatography was performed on a 250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm C18 column with a gradient mixture of a phosphate buffer-methanol 60:40 (v/v) at 1.0 mL min(-1). Ultraviolet detection of apixaban was at 220 nm. The method was validated for linearity, precision, repeatability, sensitivity, and selectivity. Selectivity was validated by subjecting apixaban solution to photolytic, acidic, basic, oxidative, and thermal degradation. The peaks from the degradation products did not interfere with that from apixaban. The method was used to quantify the related substances in apixaban in the bulk drug and can be used for routine quality control purposes.

VPatient-posture and Ileal-intubation during colonoscopy (PIC): a randomized controlled open-label trial.
p1125
aVPatient's posture change is commonly employed by a colonoscopist to achieve complete examination. We studied whether patient's posture (left-lateral decubitus vs supine) influenced the success rate of ileal intubation.In this prospective open-label randomized study performed in the Endoscopy Suite of a tertiary-care center, all adult outpatients referred for colonoscopy, in whom cecal intubation was achieved and who satisfied predefined inclusion criteria, were randomized to undergo ileal intubation in either of the above two postures. Colonoscopy (EC-201 WL, Fujinon) was performed after overnight poly-ethylene-glycol preparation, under conscious sedation and continuous pulse-oxymetry monitoring. After confirming cecal intubation, patients were randomized for ileal intubation. Success was defined by visualization of ileal mucosa or villi (confirmed by digital photography) and was attempted until limited by pain and/or time of \u2265\u200a6\u200amin.Of 320 eligible patients, 217 patients (150 males) were randomized, 106 to left-lateral decubitus and 111 to supine posture. At baseline, the two groups were evenly matched. Successful ileal intubation was achieved in 145 (66.8\u200a%) patients overall, significantly higher in the supine posture (74.8\u200a% versus 58.5\u200a%; P\u200a=\u200a0.014). On multivariate analysis, supine posture (P\u200a=\u200a0.02), average/good right-colon preparation (P\u200a<\u200a0.01), non-thin-lipped ileocecal (IC) valve (P\u200a<\u200a0.001) and younger age (P\u200a=\u200a0.02) were independent predictors of success. Positive ileal findings were recorded in 13 (9\u200a%) patients.Ileoscopy is more successful in supine than in left-lateral decubitus posture. Age, bowel preparation and type of IC valve also determine success.

VSynthesis and biological evaluation of some novel 1-substituted fentanyl analogs in Swiss albino mice.
p1128
aVFentanyl [N-(1-phenethyl-4-piperidinyl)propionanilide] is a potent opioid analgesic agent, but a has narrow therapeutic index. We reported earlier on the synthesis and bioefficacy of fentanyl and its 1-substituted analogs (1-4) in mice. Here we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of four additional analogs, viz. N-isopropyl-3-(4-(N-phenylpropionamido)piperidin-1-yl)propanamide (5), N-t-butyl-3-(4-(N-phenylpropionamido)piperidin-1-yl)propanamide (6), isopropyl 2-[4-(N-phenylpropionamido)piperidin-1-yl]propionate (7) and t-butyl 2-[4-(N-phenylpropionamido)piperidin-1-yl]propionate (8). The median lethal dose (LD50) determined by intravenous, intraperitoneal and oral routes suggests these analogs to be comparatively less toxic than fentanyl. On the basis of observational assessment on spontaneous activities of the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems, all the analogs were found to be similar to fentanyl. Naloxone hydrochloride abolished the neurotoxic effects of these analogs, thereby ascertaining their opioid receptor-mediated effects. All the analogs displayed significant analgesic effects, measured by formalin-induced hind paw licking and tail immersion tests at their respective median effective dose (ED50). They also exhibited 8-12 fold increase in therapeutic index over fentanyl. However, 5 and 6 alone produced lower ED50 (20.5 and 21.0 µg/kg, respectively) and higher potency ratio (1.37 and 1.33, respectively) compared to fentanyl. They could thus be considered for further studies on pain management.

VToxicity, mechanism and health effects of some heavy metals.
p1131
aVHeavy metal toxicity has proven to be a major threat and there are several health risks associated with it. The toxic effects of these metals, even though they do not have any biological role, remain present in some or the other form harmful for the human body and its proper functioning. They sometimes act as a pseudo element of the body while at certain times they may even interfere with metabolic processes. Few metals, such as aluminium, can be removed through elimination activities, while some metals get accumulated in the body and food chain, exhibiting a chronic nature. Various public health measures have been undertaken to control, prevent and treat metal toxicity occurring at various levels, such as occupational exposure, accidents and environmental factors. Metal toxicity depends upon the absorbed dose, the route of exposure and duration of exposure, i.e. acute or chronic. This can lead to various disorders and can also result in excessive damage due to oxidative stress induced by free radical formation. This review gives details about some heavy metals and their toxicity mechanisms, along with their health effects.

aVIn the present study, porous PLGA microparticulate scaffolds (PMS_P), surface-hydrolysed scaffolds (PMS_Hyd) and cytomodulin-coupled scaffolds (PMS_CM) were prepared and characterized. After coupling the particles with cytomodulin, the size was reduced from 334\u2009µm (span 0.53) to 278\u2009µm due to hydrolysis, and contact angle also decreased from 70.87\u2009±\u20098.56 to 31.43\u2009±\u20097.43, indicating an increase in hydrophilicity. Surface roughness and pore density increased, along with an increase in surface area from 9.59\u2009±\u20090.36 to 16.82\u2009±\u20090.064\u2009m(2) /g after attaching the biomolecule CM onto the PLGA particles. In vitro cell culture experiments on human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) were performed for 21\u2009days, in which MTT assay indicated two-fold higher cell proliferation on PMS_Hyd than on PMS_CM; however, cell distribution, cell spreading and actin production were significantly higher on PMS_CM than on other scaffolds. Migration of cells from PMS_CM to a 2D plate was gradual but the migrated cells attained early confluence, indicating the preservation of normal cellular functions. In a full-thickness wound mouse model, PMS_CM exhibited 80% wound closure within 2\u2009weeks. Further, at the end of week 3, the inflammatory cell count in the PMS_CM group was reduced to one-third of the control group, while in PMS_P and PMS_Hyd the extent of inflammation was much higher and more severe. In the case of PMS_CM, abundant fibroblast proliferation, early formation of the scar tissue, eschar formation and inward movement of the wound margins (a zipper-like movement) towards the deeper layers of the skin suggested advanced wound healing. Cytomodulin-coupled scaffolds ensured better cell spreading and migration and thus enabled rapid wound healing (see Supporting information, Figure\u2009S1).

VHuman DNA damage by the synergistic action of 4-aminobiphenyl and nitric oxide: an immunochemical study.
p1137
aV4-Aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), an aromatic amine is a major environmental carcinogen found mainly in cigarette smoke. It has been vastly implicated in mutagenesis and cancer development. In this study, commercially available human placental DNA was exposed to 4-ABP (1.3 mM) in presence of sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 8 mM) at 37°C for 3 h. The 4-ABP + SNP-mediated structural changes in human DNA were studied by ultraviolet, circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy, thermal melting profile, agarose gel electrophoresis, and nuclease S1 digestibility assay. Spectroscopical analysis and melting temperature studies suggest structural perturbations in the DNA as a result of modification. This might be due to generation of single-stranded regions and destabilization of hydrogen bonds. Modification was also visualized in agarose gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, nuclease S1 digestibility confirmed the generation of single strand breaks. Rabbits challenged with 4-ABP-SNP-modified human DNA-induced high-titer immunogen-specific antibodies, which showed Cross-reaction with modified/unmodified DNA bases and ss-DNA in competitive inhibition assay. The immunogen specificity of induced antibodies against 4-ABP-SNP-modified human DNA was further confirmed in gel retardation assay. It may be concluded that induction of anti-modified DNA antibodies could be due to perturbation in the DNA structure and its subsequent recognition by immunoregulatory cells as a foreign molecule.

Pregnant rats were injected with DBP and F1 male rats were weaned and on postnatal day 100, used for mating with normal cycling females to assess reproductive performance. After completion of cohabitation period, rats were analyzed for other reproductive end points. Transplacental exposure to DBP significantly decreased fertility in adult male rats. Prenatal exposure to DBP significantly decreased sperm density, number of motile sperms, viable sperms, and hypoosmotic swelling tail coiled sperms with an increase in morphological abnormalities in sperms. Testicular steroidogenic enzyme activity levels and serum testosterone levels were significantly decreased in rats exposed to DBP during embryonic development. In conclusion, transplacental exposure to DBP impairs male reproductive performance by decreasing steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis.

VPalliative stenting of patent ductus arteriosus in older children and young adults with congenital cyanotic heart disease.
p1147
aVTo describe the indications, technique and results (early and short-term follow-up) of palliative patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stenting in selected patients (2 years and older) with congenital cyanotic heart disease with reduced pulmonary blood flow who were not candidates for definitive surgery in the immediate future.Stenting of PDA as a palliation has been advocated as safe and effective procedure in neonates, but this modality is underutilized for children and adults.Hospital records of patients (\u22652 years) undergoing PDA stenting between January 2007 and September 2009 were reviewed. The access and approach was dictated by the anatomy of the PDA. A coronary guiding catheter or a long sheath was used to access the PDA. Coronary or peripheral stents were used for stenting.Fifteen patients with median age 14 years (range: 2-18 years); median weight 17.5 kg (range: 7-57 Kg) were included. Indication for intervention was hypoxia (mean saturation 69% ± 8.9%, hemoglobin 19.8 ± 2.69 g/dl), unsuitable anatomy or economic considerations. Successful stenting was accomplished in all (mean fluoroscopy time of 24.6 ± 16.7 min) with no complications and the saturations improved to mean of 88% ± 2.3 %. The most recent oxygen saturations on follow-up (median: 13 months; range: 1-21 months) were 82% ± 2.8%. One patient underwent corrective repair.PDA stenting can provide effective palliation in selected older patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease.

VHyperprolactinemia with aripiprazole: understanding the paradox.
p1150
aVAripiprazole, due to its partial agonist activity at the D2 receptors, is often recommended as the drug of choice in patients who develop antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia. We report a case of a female patient who developed hyperprolactinemia while on treatment with aripiprazole. This partial D2 agonistic activity of aripiprazole could be dose related, and hence, at higher doses, aripiprazole by itself can have dopamine antagonistic properties and hence cause prolactin system abnormalities.

p1162
aVThe black turtle bean (BTB) is most widely consumed legume all over the world having anticancer activity. The aim of the study was to analyse the apoptotic effects of BTB extracts on human breast cancer cell lines. Plant extract was prepared by homogenization and centrifugation. The cytotoxic effects of BTB was evaluated by MTT assay and their apoptotic effects were characterized by DNA fragmentation, nuclear staining assay, mitochondrial membrane potential analysis, annexin-V FITC and caspase 3/7 activity assay. The changes in cell cycle and gene expression of cell lines were analysed by flow cytometry and qRT-PCR, respectively. BTB extract showed cytotoxicity with IC50 values of 50 \u03bcg/ml in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells. The caspase 3/7 was activated in the cancer cells treated with BTB extract leading to cell death by apoptosis. Moreover, there was significant increase in the expression of Bax as well as decrease in the Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression with in a dose dependent manner in both cells. It induces cell cycle arrest in S and G2/M phase in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells, respectively. The mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased in BTB treated cells thereby transducing the apoptotic signal through the mitochondrial pathway and it also causes DNA fragmentation. Thus, it can be concluded that BTB induces the apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells through intrinsic and extrinsic pathway and can be explored further for promising candidate to combat breast cancer. BTB extract exhibit anti-cancer activity by inducing apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines.

aVCardiac Resynchronization therapy (CRT) remains largely under-used in developing countries owing to the high cost of therapy. In this pilot study, we explore 'optimized' Left Ventricle Only Pacing (LVOP) as a cost effective alternative to cardiac resynchronization therapy in selected patients with heart failure.In economically poorer patients with heart failure, left bundle branch block (LBBB) and intact AV node conduction, synchronization can be obtained using a dual chamber pacemaker (leads in right atrium and Left ventricle) with the help of 2D strain imaging.4 patients underwent LVOP for symptomatic heart failure. Post procedure 'optimization' was done using 12 lead electrocardiography and 2D- Strain imaging. Difference between Time to Peak longitudinal strain and Aortic valve Closure (Diff TPL-AC) was calculated for each segment at different AV delays and the AV delay with the smallest Diff TPL-AC was programmed. The mean AV delay that resulted in electrical and mechanical synchrony was 150 ms. After a mean follow up of 6 months, all patients had improved by at least 1 NYHA class. The mean reduction in QRS duration post procedure was -54.5 ± 22.82 ms and the mean improvement in EF was 7 ± 2.75%.Optimized LVOP using 2D strain and ECG can be a cost-effective alternative to CRT in patients with LBBB, heart failure and normal AV node conduction.

aVTo study the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the outcome of acute lower respiratory infection in hospitalized children.This is an open label parallel group randomized trial. Total of 154 children aged 2 mo-5 yrs (mean age 13 mo) admitted with acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) were randomized to receive standard care therapy alone or standard care therapy for the respiratory infection along with a single oral dose of 100,000 IU of vitamin D3. Serum 25(OH)D levels were measured at admission in all the children and 72 h after administration of vitamin D in the supplemented group. Primary outcome measured was the duration of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes measured were mortality, incidence of complications, admission to PICU and recurrence of respiratory infections within 90 days of discharge. Primary outcome was compared using Mann Whitney U test and secondary outcomes were compared using chi-square or Fischer's exact test.Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome (Median duration of hospital stay in both the groups) and also in secondary outcomes (mortality, PICU admission, complications and recurrence of respiratory infections within 90 days of discharge).Single oral dose of 100,000 IU of vitamin D3 did not lead to reduction in duration of hospital stay, mortality, PICU admission or complications related to ALRI when compared to standard therapy alone in under five children hospitalized with ALRI but was able to achieve serum vitamin D sufficiency within 72 h of administration.

aVTo compare the effectiveness and safety of two minimally invasive methods (transrectal aspiration vs transurethral resection (TUR)/deroofing) of treating prostatic abscess.A retrospective study was conducted, from 2007 to 2016, of patients with prostatic abscesses not responding to antibiotics and/or with large (>2 cm) or multiple abscesses. Patients were divided into two groups depending on treatment received: Group A, transrectal aspiration; and Group B, TUR/deroofing of abscess.The most common clinical presentation was dysuria (81.8%), followed by urinary frequency (68.2%), and fever (36.4%). Acute urinary retention occurred in seven patients. The most common infective organism in both groups was Escherichia coli (43.9%). The mean (SD, range) prostate volume was 36 (6.4, 17-68) mL and 37 (7.3, 21-72) mL in Groups A and B, respectively. The mean (SD, range) volume of the abscess was 51.24 (12.6, 21-215) mL and 48.34 (15.4, 15-240) mL in Groups A and B, respectively. Overall, 37 (84.1%) patients responded to treatment (68.4% in Group A and 96.0% in Group B, P < 0.23) after the first treatment session. Six patients in Group A and one patient in Group B had recurrence of abscess (P < 0.03). Of the six patients in Group A with recurrence, four patients had complete resolution after repeat aspiration (average 1-3 times). The mean (SD) follow-up duration was 17.25 (6.3) months.TUR of prostatic abscess is more effective (96%) than transrectal aspiration with a lesser hospital stay. However, transrectal aspiration was successful in 89% of cases, is less invasive and can be performed under local anaesthesia and or sedation.

p1181
aVTo devise a minimally invasive, less morbid yet effective alternative technique for basilic vein transposition (BVT) in the arm/forearm and to compare perioperative outcomes with the conventional technique.Patients undergoing BVT in the last two years (June 2013 to June 2015) were included in the study and the results were analysed. All patients were preoperatively evaluated using colour Doppler ultrasonography performed by the operating surgeon himself. For minimally invasive BVT, two or three small 1-2 cm incisions were made to completely mobilise the basilic vein, transposed in an anterolateral arm/forearm tunnel, and then anastomosed to the brachial or radial artery in the forearm and arm, respectively. The incision in the conventional technique was along the full length of the basilic vein, with the rest of the procedure remaining the same. Complications, pain, analgesic use, maturation and primary patency rates were compared between the techniques.In all, 30 patients underwent minimally invasive BVT and 34 patients underwent conventional BVT, with mean age of 52 and 55 years, respectively. The complications of wound haematoma (one vs four) and wound infection/dehiscence (two vs six) were less common in the minimally invasive BVT group compared to the conventional group. The analgesic requirement and visual analogue scale pain score was significantly less in the minimally invasive BVT group. All other variables assessed, such as maturation and primary patency rate at 1 year, were not significantly different between the groups.Minimally invasive dissection of the basilic vein for vascular access transposition is a safe, reliable procedure with patency and functional outcomes comparable with those of conventional BVT.

VToxigenic Clostridium difficile isolates from clinically significant diarrhoea in patients from a tertiary care centre.
p1189
aVClostridium difficile is the primary cause of hospital-acquired colitis in patients receiving antibiotics. The pathogenicity of the organism is mainly due to the production of toxins. This study was conducted to investigate the presence of toxigenic C. difficile in the faecal samples of hospitalized patients suspected to have C. difficile infection (CDI) and corroborating the findings with their clinical and demographic data.Diarrhoeic samples obtained from 1110 hospitalized patients were cultured for C. difficile and the isolates confirmed by phenotypic and molecular methods. Toxigenicity of the isolates was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for toxins A and B. Details of patients included in the study were noted and analyzed.Of the 1110 patients (mean age 39±19.6 yr), 63.9 per cent were males and 36.1 per cent were females. The major antibiotics received by the patients were nitazoxanide (23.9%), penicillins/penicillin combinations (19.0%), quinolones including fluoroquinolones (13.1%), carbapenems (11.5%), glycopeptides (11.0%) and cephalosporins (8.4%). The clinical symptoms predominantly present were watery diarrhoea (56.4%), fever (40.0%) and abdominal pain (35.3%). The underlying diseases were gastrointestinal disorders (52.6%), followed by cancers (13.2%), surgical conditions (8.3%), and hepatic disorders (8.0%). Of the 174 C. difficile isolates, 54.6 per cent were toxigenic. Toxigenic C. difficile was present in all patients with surgical conditions, 65.2 per cent with cancers and 57.1 per cent with gastrointestinal disorders.C. difficile was found to be an important cause of gastrointestinal infections in hospitalized patients with underlying diseases and on antibiotics. Clinical conditions of the patients correlating with toxigenic culture can be an important tool for establishing CDI diagnosis.

p1192
aVCentral nervous system (CNS) infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is the most severe form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) due to a high level of mortality and morbidity. Limited studies are available on CNS-TB animal model development. The present study describes the development of a murine model of CNS-TB using a clinical strain (C3) isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of CNS-TB patients.Groups of mice were infected by the intravenous route with MTB C3 strain isolated from the CSF of CNS-TB patients. Brain and lung tissue were evaluated for bacterial burden, histopathology and surrogate markers of TB infection at 30 and 50 days post-infection.Mice infected intravenously with MTB C3 strains showed progressive development of CNS disease with high bacillary burden in lungs at the initial stage (30 days), which eventually disseminated to the brain at a later stage (50 days). Similarly, high mortality (60%) was associated in mice infected with C3 strain compared to control.The study showed development of a novel murine model of CNS-TB using the C3 strain of MTB that replicated events of extrapulmonary dissemination. The developed model would be helpful in understanding the pathogenesis of CNS-TB infection for the development of improved therapeutic interventions in future.

aVHospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are a major challenge to patient safety and have serious public health implications by changing the quality of life of patients and sometimes causing disability or even death. The true burden of HAI remains unknown, particularly in developing countries. The objective of this study was to estimate point prevalence of HAI and study the associated risk factors in a tertiary care hospital in Pune, India.A series of four cross-sectional point prevalence surveys were carried out between March and August 2014. Data of each patient admitted were collected using a structured data entry form. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines were used to identify and diagnose patients with HAI.Overall prevalence of HAI was 3.76 per cent. Surgical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (25%), medical ICU (20%), burns ward (20%) and paediatric ward (12.17%) were identified to have significant association with HAI. Prolonged hospital stay [odds ratio (OR=2.81), mechanical ventilation (OR=18.57), use of urinary catheter (OR=7.89) and exposure to central air-conditioning (OR=8.59) had higher odds of acquiring HAI (P<0.05).HAI prevalence showed a progressive reduction over successive rounds of survey. Conscious effort needs to be taken by all concerned to reduce the duration of hospital stay. Use of medical devices should be minimized and used judiciously. Healthcare infection control should be a priority of every healthcare provider. Such surveys should be done in different healthcare settings to plan a response to reducing HAI.

This analysis was undertaken to examine the prevalence along with predictors of intimate partner violence (IPV) and its association with HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Indian ever-married women.The data obtained from 2005 to 2006 third round of National Family Health Survey-3 (NFHS-3) were used in this study. Analyses were conducted on ever-married women by linking individual women data including violence information and HIV test results.The analyses indicated all forms of violence to be prevalent in India. The prevalence of lifetime IPV reported was 35.3 per cent. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression identified younger age of women, higher number of children, low level of education of women as well as her partner, working status of women, higher spousal age, rural residence, alcohol consumption by husband, childhood witness of violence among parents, nuclear household and lower standard of living to be positively associated with the experience of IPV by the women (P<0.05). HIV-positive status of women, as well as women from high HIV prevalent State, were at increased odds of IPV (P<0.05).Significantly higher reporting of HIV/STIs by women experiencing IPV hints at new pathways that link violence and HIV. Further, our analysis showed a high prevalence of IPV in India.

aVData on hypogonadism among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected Indians are not available. This study was aimed to evaluate the occurrence, pattern and predictors of hypogonadism in HIV-infected Indians.Consecutive stable HIV-infected patients, 18-70 yr age, without any severe comorbid state, having at least one year follow up data at the antiretroviral therapy clinic, underwent clinical assessment and hormone assays.From initially screened 527 patients, 359 patients (225 males; 134 females), having disease duration of 61.44±39.42 months, 88.58 per cent on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), 40.67 per cent having tuberculosis history and 89.69 per cent with vitamin D insufficiency were analyzed. Testosterone <300 ng/dl was documented in 39.11 per cent males. Primary, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HypoH) and compensated hypogonadism were observed in 7.56, 31.56 and 12.44 per cent males, respectively. Males with hypogonadism were significantly older (P=0.009), and had higher opportunistic infections (P<0.001) with longer disease duration (P=0.05). Menstrual abnormalities were observed in 40.3 per cent females, who were significantly older (P<0.001), had lower CD4 count (P=0.038) and higher tuberculosis history (P=0.005). Nearly 46.3, 16.2 and 13 per cent women with menstrual abnormalities were in peri-/post-menopausal state, premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and HypoH, respectively. Age, CD4 count at diagnosis and 25(OH)D were best predictors of male hypogonadism. Age and CD4 count increment in first 6-12 months following HAART were the best predictors of POI.Hypogonadism was observed to be a significant problem in HIV-infected men and women in India, affecting 39 and 29 per cent patients, respectively. HypoH was the most common form in males whereas ovarian failure being the most common cause in females.

Their demographic characteristics, lifestyle, education and employment were noted. Lumbosacral MRI was carried out and 19 MRI parameters at six levels (D12-L1-L5-S1) were noted. The severity of pain was assessed by Numeric Rating Scale (NRS, 0-10) and disability by Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).MRI was abnormal in all patients, the most common being disc desiccation (90.3%) followed by facet joint arthropathy (FJA; 75%) and nerve root compression (NRC; 72.2%). Endplate changes and high-intensity zone were noted in 58 and 50 per cent of patients, respectively. One-third patients with FJA, however, were below 30 yr of age. NRC on MRI had 61.3 per cent sensitivity and 10 per cent specificity with clinical radiculopathy. FJA had 60.7 per cent sensitivity and 15.9 per cent specificity with localized CLBA. None of the MRI parameters and MRI sum score correlated with NRS and ODI. On multivariate analysis, NRS was independent predictor of ODI (odds ratio 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.35-0.98, P=0.04).In patients with CLBA, NRC on MRI showed poor specificity with corresponding clinical radiculopathy and FJA with localized backache. None of the MRI abnormality correlated with the severity of pain or disability.

VCoping in residual schizophrenia: Re-analysis of ways of Coping checklist.
p1208
aVPersons with schizophrenia use various coping strategies to adapt to distressing symptoms as well as to deal with daily stressors. Efforts have been made to explore alternative frameworks of coping using Ways of Coping Checklist (WCC) in persons with schizophrenia. This study aimed to re-analyze (factor analysis) the revised-WCC in Indian patients with residual schizophrenia. The secondary aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship of new framework of coping with psychopathology, disability and quality of life (QOL).Using a cross-sectional design, 103 patients with residual schizophrenia were assessed on WCC. A principal component analysis with varimax rotation was carried out to determine the factor structure of WCC.Factor analysis yielded six factors which explained 51.6 per cent of the total variance and had acceptable-to-good internal consistency. Based on the type of items loaded, the six factors were named as follows: active and growth-oriented coping, accepting and fantasizing, reflective and confrontative coping, detachment, seeking social support and negative emotional coping. Patients most often used coping strategy of seeking social support, followed by 'accepting and fantasizing' and 'active and growth-oriented coping'. Correlation analysis showed that those who more often used 'active and growth-oriented coping' had less negative symptoms, lower level of disability and higher spiritual and overall QOL.The factor structure of revised-WCC was different among patients with schizophrenia when compared with individuals without mental illness, living in the community. It was evident that use of certain adaptive coping strategies was associated with better QOL and lower level of psychopathology. Our findings provided a framework of coping in patients with residual schizophrenia and suggested that promotion of certain coping strategies might be useful in improving the QOL and reduction of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia.

The present work was conducted to examine the relative expression of 18 key inflammatory genes associated with MetS and incident CAD in a representative group of patients.A total of 178 male patients, including 57 with CAD and 121 without CAD, were enrolled in the study. The participants without CAD were characterized for the presence of MetS using modified criteria specific for Asian Indians, which included a lower cut-off for waist circumference (\u226590 cm for men). The expression of 18 inflammatory genes was evaluated in peripheral whole blood by quantitative polymerase chain reaction method.Of the 121 participants without CAD, 53 (43.8%) had three or more risk factors (MetS group), 50 (41.3%) had one or two risk factors (non-MetS group), while 18 (14.8%) did not have any risk factors (control group). High nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) expression levels and low interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels were observed in MetS patients. Linear association was seen between NF-\u03baB and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression and with increase in MetS components. Comparison of gene expression pattern between CAD and MetS revealed significantly higher expression of leukotriene genes - arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (ALOX5 AP), leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) and leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S), and lower expression of NF-\u03baB, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) genes in CAD. There was linear increase in expression of LTA4H, LTC4S, IL-8 and VEGFA genes across the four groups, namely from controls, non-MetS, MetS and CAD.A distinct gene expression pattern was seen in MetS and CAD implying a well-orchestrated inflammatory and immune activity. Specifically, NF-\u03baB might be playing an active role in MetS, allowing further expansion of the inflammatory process with resolution of inflammation in full-blown CAD, wherein other gene players such as leukotrienes may dominate.

Here proliferative potential and concentration of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines secreted by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of T1DM and LADA patients were compared, after in vitro stimulation with \u03b2-cell autoantigens.A total of 19 patients with LADA, 37 with T1DM and 20 healthy controls were compared on the basis of lymphocyte proliferation and secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines belonging to different T-helper types after in vitro stimulation of PBMCs with insulin and glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65).Following insulin stimulation, LADA group secreted higher concentration of interleukin-17 (IL-17) (P=0.02) and had higher proportion of interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) secretors (P<0.001) than T1DM group. Post-GAD65 stimulation, higher proportion of LADA patients secreted IL-23 than T1DM group (P=0.02). Proportion of responders , as well as levels of secreted IL-10, were significantly higher in LADA than T1DM group, following stimulation with both insulin (P=0.01) and GAD65 (P=0.03). A significant positive correlation was observed between body mass index and IL-17 levels (r=0.41, P=0.04) and fasting plasma C-peptide with IL-10 levels (r=0.37, P=0.04).There are differences in the portfolio of cytokine secretion in diabetic subjects with varying rates of \u03b2-cell destruction as LADA subjects secrete higher levels of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines on exposure to \u03b2-cell autoantigens, thus highlighting another distinguishing feature in the pathophysiology of the two forms of autoimmune diabetes.

VAssociation of rheumatic fever & rheumatic heart disease with plausible early & late-stage disease markers.
p1219
aVRheumatic fever (RF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) are the autoimmune sequelae caused by Group A Streptococcus. RHD still remains a major concern in the developing countries due to its poor diagnosis, lack of vaccines and social awareness among population. This study was aimed to identify the plausible early- and late-stage disease markers associated with RF/RHD.A total of 84 patients with confirmed pharyngitis (n=18), RF (n=23) and RHD (n=43) were included in the comparative analysis of different factors involved in host-pathogen interaction during RF/RHD pathogenesis.This study revealed high titre of serum antistreptolysin O (ASO) antibody in pharyngitis compared to RF and RHD patients, whereas procollagen type 1 C-peptide (PICP) level was elevated in RHD which showed an inverse correlation with serum ASO titre. The significant elevation of serum anti-peptide associated with RF (PARF) antibody in RF patients was correlated as a probable stage-specific determinant. In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokine profile revealed high levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12)/IL-23p40, IL-17A in RF, whereas IL-6 concentration was higher in RHD compared to healthy controls.The overall assessment of the factors/ disease markers involved in host-pathogen interaction in RF/RHD may be suggestive of plausible disease marker in different groups of patients. Further studies with larger sample need to be done to better understand RF/RHD pathogenesis.

VGenetic variations in the Dravidian population of South West coast of India: Implications in designing case-control studies.
p1222
aVIndian data have been largely missing from genome-wide databases that provide information on genetic variations in different populations. This hinders association studies for complex disorders in India. This study was aimed to determine whether the complex genetic structure and endogamy among Indians could potentially influence the design of case-control studies for autoimmune disorders in the south Indian population.A total of 12 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) related to genes associated with autoimmune disorders were genotyped in 370 healthy individuals belonging to six different caste groups in southern India. Allele frequencies were estimated; genetic divergence and phylogenetic relationship within the various caste groups and other HapMap populations were ascertained.Allele frequencies for all genotyped SNVs did not vary significantly among the different groups studied. Wright's FSTwas 0.001 per cent among study population and 0.38 per cent when compared with Gujarati in Houston (GIH) population on HapMap data. The analysis of molecular variance results showed a 97 per cent variation attributable to differences within the study population and <1 per cent variation due to differences between castes. Phylogenetic analysis showed a separation of Dravidian population from other HapMap populations and particularly from GIH population.Despite the complex genetic origins of the Indian population, our study indicated a low level of genetic differentiation among Dravidian language-speaking people of south India. Case-control studies of association among Dravidians of south India may not require stratification based on language and caste.

VSudden unexpected death in epilepsy.
p1225
aVPeople with epilepsy have increased risk of premature death, and their life expectancy may reduce by 2-10 yr. Population- and hospital-based studies have shown that the excess mortality in epilepsy is not entirely explained by deaths directly attributable to epilepsy such as accidents and drowning during a seizure. It is also significantly contributed by deaths from other causes such as cardiac deaths, deaths due to malignancies and other causes. It had recently been recognized that sudden unexpected deaths in epilepsy (SUDEP) contributed to a small yet important proportion of mortality in epilepsy. SUDEPs are deaths (witnessed or unwitnessed) unrelated to trauma, drowning or status epilepticus and not attributable to any specific medical conditions. Several factors related to epilepsy and drug therapy have been found to be associated with higher risk of SUDEP.

VTelomere length as a potential biomarker of coronary artery disease.
p1229
aVCoronary artery disease (CAD) is a multifactorial disease whose prevalence remains unabated especially in developing countries. Both lifestyle factors and genetic predisposition contribute to this disorder. Though notable achievements have been made in the medical, interventional and surgical management of CAD, the need for its prevention is more important. Among other modalities, this calls for defining evidence-based new biomarkers, which on their own or in combination with other known biomarkers may predict the risk of CAD to enable institution of appropriate preventive strategies. In the present communication, we have discussed the usefulness of shortening of telomeres as a potential biomarker of CAD. Clinical research evidence in favour of telomere shortening in CAD is well documented in different ethnic populations of the world. Establishing a well-standardized and accurate method of evaluating telomere length is essential before its routine use in preventive cardiology.

VAlzheimer's disease: An alternative approach.
p1232
aVAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative cortical dementia. It starts with memory loss, spatial disorientation in people above the age of 65 yr with a preference to females. Its incidence is expected to increase threefold by 2050. It affects almost one out of ten persons above the age of 65 years. Majority of patients are sporadic, but a very small percentage is autosomal dominant. The pathomechanisms postulated include amyloid cascade hypothesis according to which mutation in amyloid precursor protein causes A\u03b2 aggregation. The next hypothesis is signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3) causing aberration in intracellular signalling pathways. Senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are other important pathological changes reported. It is observed that dementia research has not yielded the expected result world over, and therefore, the pitfalls with reference to known facts about diagnosis, clinical features, pathogenic mechanisms, assessment of progression, biomarkers, treatment and prevention, as well as brief information on our experiments with relatively inexpensive methods of differentiating the most common types of dementia AD and frontotemporal dementia are discussed.

VEvaluation of baseline ECG in patients undergoing Oral Flecainide Challenge test for suspected Brugada Syndrome: An analysis of lead II.
p1241
aVWe analyzed Lead II in patients undergoing an Oral Flecainide Challenge test (FCT), to identify any pointers that could predict a positive FCT and thereby help in recognition of latent BS.The following parameters in lead II were retrospectively analyzed from the pre-test ECG in 62 patients undergoing FCT for suspected BS: The presence or absence of S waves, S wave amplitude, duration and upslope duration; J point parameters- Early repolarization, QRS notch, and QRS Slur; ST segment parameters-lack of isoelectric ST segment, ST duration and QT interval.48 had positive FCT (Group-1) while 14 were negative for FCT(Group-2). Lack of an isoelectric ST segment (50% vs 14.29%, p = 0.018) and slurring of QRS (33.33% vs 0%, p = 0.014) was more common in Group-1 than Group-2. Group-1 had shorter ST segment duration (median 81.5 (IQR 64-103.5) vs 110 (IQR 90-132), p = 0.002) and shorter ST: QT ratio (median 0.28 (IQR 0.22-0.35) vs 0.23 (0.18-0.27), p = 0.007). QRS notch/depressed J point (87.5%), QRS slur (100%), and lack of isoelectric ST segment (92.31%) had high sensitivity for predicting an inducible Type 1 Brugada pattern. Combining two parameters- ST: QT ratio<0.24 and lack of isoelectric ST segment-considerably improved the specificity (73.3%), and the positive predictive value of the test to 76%. The results remained accurate when validated in a small prospective cohort.Shortened ST segment in Lead II, lack of isoelectric ST segment, slurred QRS and ST/QT ratio <0.24 are predictive of underlying Brugada pattern in baseline ECG.

aVTo study the chemical constituents and larvicidal activity of essential oil extracted from the leaves of Coccinia grandis against three mosquito species.Essential oil was extracted by hydro distillation using clevenger apparatus and was analyzed for chemical constituents by gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS). Larvicidal activity was recorded after 12 and 24h of post-exposure against three mosquito species, Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus. Dead larvae were identified when they failed to move after probing with a needle in the siphon or cervical region. The LC50 and LC90 values for three mosquito larvae were calculated by Probit analysis.The GC-MS analysis revealed that essential oil contains 23 different constituents. Out of these 23 constituents, major constituents identified were n-tetracosane (39.18%), n-eicosane (30.04%), tetratriacotane (2.97%), 7-octadecanal (2.81%), and tricosane (2.31%). Essential oil from leaves of Coccinia grandis exhibited significant larvicidal activity against An. stephensi with LC50 and LC90 values 39.41ppm and 123.24ppm, respectively. This was followed by Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus with LC50 and LC90 values of 48.20ppm, 131.84ppm and 52.80ppm, 135.48ppm, respectively after 24h of exposure.The results could be useful in developing a cost effective, ecofriendly, region specific and practical strategy for the control of mosquito vectors.

There is a need for a self-rated instrument to assess this construct in resource-strained clinical settings of India.To explore the factor structure of Hindi version of Family Accommodation Scale-Self Rated version (FAS-SR) and compare its validity with the gold standard Family Accommodation Scale-Interviewer Rated (FAS-IR) scale.The Hindi version of FAS-SR scale and FAS-IR scale was applied on 105 caregivers of patients with OCD.The initial factor analysis yielded three-factor models with an eigenvalue of >1 and the total variance explained by these factors was 72.017%. The internal consistency of the 19-item scale was 0.93 indicating good inter-item correlation. There was a significant positive correlation between FAS-IR scale total score and all the factors of the FAS-SR Scale. The average measure ICC was 0.889 with a 95% confidence interval from 0.783 to 0.981 (F (62,84)=37.547, p<001) indicating high degree of reliability between the Hindi version of FAS-SR and the FAS-IR scale.FAS-SR is a practical alternative to FAS-IR and has the potential to be used widely in an Indian setting.

aVThe aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Depression among women aged 40-60 years in the rural area of Kerala using Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9).Ambalappuzha is an area of rural background under the District of Alappuzha. The study was conducted by Preventive and Social Medicine department of Govt. T. D. Medical College, Kerala in collaboration with the department of Psychiatry with the help of Ambalappuzha health centre.A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 594 women from 18 wards of Amabalappuzha North Panchayat using cluster sampling technique. Data on sociodemographic factors, health factors, and behavioral factors were collected from the women by investigator administered the semi-structured questionnaire. Patient Health Questionnaire9 (PHQ-9), was used for diagnosing Major Depression.The prevalence of Major Depression among middle aged women was 26.09% using the PHQ-9 diagnostic criteria and 24.2% using a PHQ-9 cut off score \u2265 10. With increasing age, there was an increasing trend in the prevalence of Depression up to the age of 55years followed by a small decline. A higher prevalence of Depression was observed among widows (43.37%), women not in a marital relation (41.38%), a woman with a history of postpartum Depression (OR 3.471), with peri-menopausal symptoms (40.28%, OR 2.86).One fourth of the women screened positive for Depression in Ambalappuzha North Panchayat (26.09%).

aVJitteriness syndrome (JS) is a poorly understood but important adverse effect of antidepressant drugs. This study examined the incidence and pattern of antidepressant-related JS and its predictors.209 patients diagnosed with any anxiety or depressive disorder and started on mirtazapine, sertraline, desvenlafaxine, escitalopram or fluoxetine were assessed at baseline, after 2 weeks, and after 6 weeks with psychopathology rating scales and for predefined categories of JS.The incidence of JS during the 6-week study was 27.7%, but only 6.7% in first 2 weeks. JS rates were similar in anxiety and depressive disorders. Mirtazapine was associated with the lowest rate of 14.3%, and other antidepressants with rates of 23-34%. High dose antidepressant treatment was significantly associated with JS (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.37-5.25). No other variable predicted JS. JS was associated with significantly higher objective ratings of psychopathology.We conclude that up to a quarter of patients may suffer JS during the first 6 weeks of antidepressant initiation; higher antidepressant dose is a risk factor.

aVThe complex intersections between non-suicidal self-injurious (NSSI) behaviours; like cutting, burning or self-hitting, and suicide attempts, are an important domain of enquiry among vulnerable adolescents and young adults. A cross-sectional survey in urban schools and colleges assessed the rates of self-injurious behaviour among Indian adolescents and young adults. Predictors of NSSI and of self-injurious behaviours with associated suicidal intent, were also examined.The sample comprised 1571 male and female students, from 19 private and government aided high schools, pre-university colleges and undergraduate colleges in an urban city in South India. Participants completed the Functional Assessment of Self-Mutilation which assesses the methods, characteristics and functions of self-injurious acts in the past 12 months. The measures of psychopathology included the Youth Self-Report and the Young-Adult Self-Report.The results indicated that rate of NSSI was 33.8%, with minor forms of self-injury reported more often (19.4%) than the moderate/severe forms (14.6%). A smaller proportion (6.8%) reported self-injurious acts with associated suicidal intent. Certain self-injury characteristics and levels of internalizing and externalizing problems differentiated self-injuring youth with and without suicidal intent. Logistic regression analyses identified predictors of any self-injurious behaviour and of self-injury associated with suicidal intent. The implications for assessment and intervention frameworks for self-injuring youth are discussed.

aVPyknodysostosis is congenital osteosclerotic skeletal dysplasia of a rare entity. It is an autosomal recessive disease which presents with short stature and generalized osteosclerosis of skeleton as result of decreased bone turnover. Here, the authors report a case of pyknodysostosis who presented to our emergency room with a pathological fracture in the shaft of the femur for which operative intervention was carried out.A 30-year-old female presented to our emergency room with a history of trivial injury to right thigh region and was diagnosed as fracture in her right femur shaft region. After a detailed clinical, radiological, and blood investigations, the patient was taken up for operative modality of intervention in the form of plate osteosynthesis. As the medullary canal was narrow and bone was osteosclerotic, the option of closed intramedullary interlocking nailing was ruled out. Hence, we proceeded with open reduction and internal fixation with plate osteosynthesis using a board dynamic compression plate. Post-operative period was uneventful. Patient underwent non-weight bearing mobilization for 2 months. At 10-week post-operative follow-up, the patient presented with pain over surgical site and radiological examination showed no signs of union. The patient underwent additional plating augmented with bone grafting using grafts harvested from iliac crest and synthetic bone graft. The patient developed deep-seated infection immediate post-operative period for which she was treated with wound debridement, and appropriate intravenous antibiotics were given 2 weeks and orally for 4 weeks. At 6-month follow-up, the patient is able to carry her day-to-day activity with complete recovery and radiological signs of union. The patient had classical clinical features suggestive of pyknodysostosis. Patient has 2 siblings of same family (one brother and sister) with similar clinical and radiological features.Recognition of these clinical and radiological signs is important to make the diagnosis of pyknodysostosis and prevent possible complications. Additional care must be taken in treating these patients.

However, undisplaced periprosthetic fractures presenting with dislocation is uncommon. We describe successful management of two cases (one bilateral dislocation and one unilateral dislocation) of undisplaced iatrogenic fractures in total hip arthroplasty (THA) presenting as early dislocation.Case 1 was a 45-year-old female with osteoarthritis of hip secondary to developmental dysplasia of the hip with bilateral early nontraumatic dislocation with bilateral identical periprosthetic fracture. It was managed by revision to long stem and encirclage wiring. Case 2 presented with early dislocation in the 2(nd) week post THA. We found an intertrochanteric fracture intra-operatively with unstable implant. Acetabular component and femoral component revision were done with reconstruction of the greater trochanter.These fractures could be occult iatrogenic fractures characteristic of taper wedge stems which presented as early nontraumatic dislocation in the post-operative period. The prosthesis subsidence, loss of muscle tension and change of version might be the factors leading to dislocation.Unrecognized incomplete intraoperative fracture can occur with tapered wedge uncemented stems which can present as a dislocation in the immediate post-operative period. This will require early revision of the femoral component.

Stress fractures of hamulus are even rarer and very few cases have been reported till date. In this case report, we present the first documented case of stress fracture of hamulus in a cricket batsman and review the existing literature on hamulus fractures, both acute and stress fractures, in sportspersons in general.A 23-year-old, right-handed, cricket batsman presented with pain in the hypothenar region of his left hand of 7 weeks duration. The pain typically worsened during batting, and he had difficulty in gripping the bat. Plain radiographs were largely inconclusive; magnetic resonance images, however, demonstrated a stress fracture of the hamate hook. The patient was put on conservative management, and his bat grip was modified. He recovered completely within 12 weeks and went back to playing professional cricket.Hamulus stress fractures should be considered in cricketers presenting with chronic, non-traumatic, and ulnar-sided hand pain. The nonleading hand is more likely to be involved in a batter, as seen in other sports with a double haSnd grip. Nonoperative treatment, change of grip and adequate rehabilitation give good outcomes in most cases.

We describe here a case of median nerve entrapment in the posteromedial dislocation of elbow in a 10-year-old male child and the role of ultrasonography (USG) in localizing the median nerve in the elbow. The nerve release was done by osteotomy of medial epicondyle. USG thus proved to be a useful tool in the management of nerve injury.The authors present here a case of 10-year-old child with a history of dislocation of right elbow that was reduced elsewhere and the child presented to us with stiffness and restriction of movements at the elbow with the features of high median nerve injury. On further evaluation with ultrasound, the median nerve was found to be entrapped in the elbow behind the medial epicondyle. Medial condyle osteotomy was done to release the median nerve and to provide the relief of symptoms.Median nerve entrapment after the elbow dislocation is a very rare entity. High index of suspicion and the ultrasound are quite helpful in arriving at the diagnosis of this rare clinical entity. Timed surgical release of the nerve and can provide good function.

aVSynovial hemangioma is a rare condition with <200 published case reports in world literature and is frequently misdiagnosed, leading to diagnostic delay of many years. This delay is even more significant if the patient comes from a rural background with a dearth of medical facilities in the area. This case had a lag of nearly 20 years from the time of onset of symptoms and the required management which is the maximum reported for any synovial hemangioma since most of them have been found and treated in adolescents.We present a case of an atypical synovial hemangioma in a 25-year-old Indian male from a poor socioeconomic background with a delay of 20 years who had both recurrent knee effusions and long-standing knee pain but kept ignoring his symptoms. It was managed by arthroscopic synovectomy. The patient reported to us after 2 years after the surgery with a painless knee and full range of movement.Synovial hemangioma mostly affects the knee joint, showing recurrent bloody effusions without a history of trauma. If there are no intermittent effusions, the diagnosis will be even more difficult. In cases of non-specific symptoms and long-standing knee pain of many years, the diagnosis of a synovial hemangioma should also be considered. In this particular case, magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate the patient after the plain radiographs and showed characteristic lace-like or linear patterns. Diagnostic arthroscopy and surgical excision were done in the same sitting, and biopsy was sent to the histopathology laboratory which confirmed our diagnosis. Although this patient had the disease since 20 years and presented late, he had little degeneration of cartilage at the time of arthroscopy. The functional outcome at 2-year follow-up was excellent, and he had no disability, effusion and was pain free.

The options include immediate repair of patellar tendon with either simultaneous or delayed reconstruction of ACL.We present a case of 30-year-old man with simultaneous ACL and patellar tendon injury sustained in a RTA, riding pillion on a bike. The mechanism of injury was a direct blow on his flexed right knee followed by landing on the ground, on his foot with a twisting valgus thrust. Following clinical examination and radiographs, MRI was done which showed complete patellar tendon mid substance rupture and ACL tear. A staged procedure was planned, and the patient was taken up for immediate patellar tendon repair. This was followed by 5 weeks of cast immobilization. After 6 weeks, the knee was mobilized and ACL reconstruction was done using hamstring graft. At last, follow-up, the patient regained full knee extension and flexion up to 120° with normal gait.High-velocity knee injuries have to be carefully evaluated for such concomitant tears, as they may be missed. If suspected, an immediate ultrasound scan or MRI should be done to confirm the injuries, especially that of the patellar tendon. As of now, a staged procedure comprising immediate patellar tendon repair followed by ACL reconstruction at a later date seems to be the better option of treatment.

VRole of WhatsApp-based discussions in improving residents' knowledge of post-operative pain management: a pilot study.
p1318
aVTo provide a platform for the dissemination of basic knowledge of pain management, a WhatsApp group was created by residents and consultants. Common clinical scenarios, resident queries, and important instructions to be followed by residents with respect to running the Acute Pain Service were discussed in the group. This study evaluates the benefits of this interaction.This study was approved by the hospital ethics board and was registered with the Clinical Trial Registry of India. Second- and third-year anesthesia residents were included in a WhatsApp group, along with consultants (board certified anesthesiologists with a special interest in pain). Pain knowledge assessment was performed pre- and post-discussion using a standard 22-point questionnaire. A feedback form, which included self-rated confidence scores (1-10, 10-most confident) and opinions about the 3-month WhatsApp discussion, was collected. Improvements in the documentation in clinical sheets post-discussion were also analyzed.A total of 38 residents were included in the WhatsApp group. An improvement in the percentage of correct answers from 69.1% (pre-discussion) to 73.6% (post-discussion) was observed (P = 0.031). Improvements in the self-rated residents' confidence levels were also noted (P < 0.05). A total of 37 residents felt that the WhatsApp-based discussion was useful. Documentation of the details of epidural blockade in clinical sheets improved from 30% to 100%.The WhatsApp discussion improved residents' knowledge and confidence levels, and also resulted in improved documentation of essential details in the clinical notes. This form of education is promising and should be explored in future studies.

VMicroRNAs in the development and neoplasia of the mammary gland.
p1324
aVStudy on the role of microRNAs (miRs) as regulators of gene expression through posttranscriptional gene silencing is currently gaining much interest,due to their wide involvement in different physiological processes. Understanding mammary gland development, lactation, and neoplasia in relation to miRs is essential. miR expression profiling of the mammary gland from different species in various developmental stages shows their role as critical regulators of development. miRs such as miR-126, miR-150, and miR-145 have been shown to be involved in lipid metabolism during lactation. In addition, lactogenic hormones influence miR expression as evidenced by overexpression of miR-148a in cow mammary epithelial cells, leading to enhanced lactation. Similarly, the miR-29 family modulates lactation-related gene expression by regulating DNA methylation of their promoters. Besides their role in development, lactation and involution, miRs are responsible for breast cancer development. Perturbed estrogen (E2) signaling is one of the major causes of breast cancer. Increased E2 levels cause altered expression of ER\u03b1, and ER\u03b1-miR cross-talk promotes tumour progression. miRs, such as miR-206, miR-34a, miR-17-5p, and miR-125 a/b are found to be tumour suppressors; whereas miR-21, miR-10B, and miR-155 are oncogenes. Oncogenic miRs like miR-21, miR-221, and miR-210 are overexpressed in triple negative breast cancer cases which can be diagnostic biomarker for this subtype of cancer.  This review focuses on the recent findings concerning the role of miRs in developmental stages of the mammary gland (mainly lactation and involution stages) and their involvement in breast cancer progression. Further studies in this area will help us to understand the molecular details of mammary gland biology, as well as miRs that could be therapeutic targets of breast cancer.

Of all PwD excluding the infective group (n = 1,777), 63% were men, 39% were from rural areas, 87% had behavioral abnormalities along with cognitive deficits, and 73% had impaired ADLs. Among dementia subtypes, a positive family history, cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, and behavioral abnormalities were found to be distributed. However, there existed a predominance of specific behavioral pattern in each subtype. The mean duration of follow-up varied from 2.9 ± 2.3 (VaD) to 3.6 ± 2.1 (AD) and greater than 30% were found to be stable on treatment (except in dementia with Lewy body).This large hospital-based study provides a distribution pattern and clinical spectrum of dementia subtypes in a North Indian population.

VItolizumab - A New Biologic for Management of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis.
p1330
aVPsoriasis is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory, immune-mediated systemic disease with mainly skin and joint manifestations. The available treatment options to cure psoriasis include topical therapy, phototherapy, and biological therapy. Biological therapy has become a promising option due to the rapid action and less adverse effects associated with its use. The newly developed biologic itolizumab is a humanized recombinant anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody of IgG1 isotype that binds to domain 1 of CD6, thereby immunomodulating human lymphocytes without interfering with the binding of CD6 to the activated leukocyte-cell adhesion molecule. In this case series, a total of 5 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis were treated with itolizumab. They exhibited a rapid PASI 75 response after 4 doses of itolizumab infusion. The patients were poor responders to methotrexate and/or cyclosporine therapy for a long time. All infusions were well tolerated by all patients with no adverse reactions or infections during the treatment period. Itolizumab can be a good option for management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

The maxillary left central incisor was dilacerated, and the maxillary left canine was partially impacted. Unilateral extraction of the left maxillary premolar and left mandibular central incisor was done. A canine disimpaction spring was used to align the impacted canine. An anterior bite plane was given to open the bite.Superimposition of lateral cephalogram (T1, T2) revealed bite opening, normal overjet and overbite. There was backward rotation of the mandible and increase in lower anterior facial height. There was no evidence of root resorption or loss of vitality in the dilacerated tooth. Clinically the canine was well aligned in the arch.Orthodontic management of a dilacerated incisor can be done without root resorption or loss of vitality. The partially impacted canine was well aligned in the arch. Unilateral extraction can produce good treatment results.

VGingival hyperplasia: Should drug interaction be blamed for?
p1337
aVGingival overgrowth (GO) is one of the common findings in clinical practice. There could be several causes including drugs associated with the GO. Carbamazepine (CBZ) and amlodipine are the drugs which are infrequently documented as a cause in inducing the gingival hyperplasia. Certain drugs in the body fluid might limit the population of plaque bacteria and alter their metabolism that in turn induce the inflammatory mediators and also activate the genetic and biochemical factors responsible for gingival fibroblast growth. Drug-induced GO is a side effect with a multifactorial etiology that seems to orchestrate the interaction between drugs and fibroblasts in the gingiva. We describe a case of trigeminal neuralgia with hypertension treated with multiple drugs including amlodipine and CBZ. Although amlodipine is known to be infrequently associated with GO, an association of CBZ with GO is even rarer. Causality analysis on the World Health Organization Uppsala Monitoring Centre's scale indicates a probable association with offending drugs.

Although it is common in first-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), it is rare in newer AEDs such as topiramate. Topiramate commonly causes neurological adverse effects such as psychomotor slowing and somnolence. Hepatotoxicity by topiramate is rare and has been previously reported in combination with other drugs such as valproate and carbamazepine. Here, we report a case of topiramate-induced asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes in an adult man diagnosed with alcohol dependence syndrome and alcohol withdrawal complicated with seizures.

aVAngiopoietin-like growth factors (ANGPTLs) regulate glucose, lipid homeostasis, and insulin sensitivity. This study aimed to find whether long-term glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c]) has any correlation with serum ANGPTL6 levels in patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus.It was an open-label, observational, prospective clinical study. Sixty-five participants (41 diabetic patients receiving daily dose of oral metformin for a minimum of 3 months and 24 matched controls) completed the study. A single venous blood sample was taken from each participant to determine serum HbA1c and serum ANGPTL6 levels. Comparison of serum ANGPTL6 levels according to the HbA1c levels, in groups A, B, and C ranging from 6.5%-8%, 8.1%-9.5%, and >9.5%, respectively, was done using Kruskal-Wallis H-test followed by pairwise comparisons.Serum HbA1c and serum ANGPTL6 levels were raised significantly (P < 0.05) in diabetic patients when compared with control participants. A positive correlation was observed between serum HbA1c and serum ANGPTL6 levels (r = 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.81, 0.92). Mean ANGPTL6 level for Group A (n = 20) was 394.3 pg/ml, for Group B (n = 8) 692.8 pg/ml, and for Group C (n = 13) 896.2 pg/ml.Serum ANGPTL6 levels were significantly higher in type 2 diabetic patients in comparison with healthy controls. Poor glycemic control in diabetes mellitus as reflected by higher serum HbA1c levels is associated with raised serum ANGPTL6 levels.

p1346
aVThe primary aim was an evaluation of the pattern of gross congenital malformations in a rat model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the secondary aim was characterization of the most common gross malformation observed.In females, the late pro-oestrous phase was identified by vaginal smear cytology, and then, they were allowed to mate at 1:3 ratio (male: female). Pregnancy was confirmed by the presence of sperm plug in the vagina and presence of sperm in the vaginal smear. In the ASD group, ASD was induced by injecting valproic acid 600 mg/kg (i.p.) to pregnant female rats (n = 18) on day 12.5 (single injection). Only vehicle (normal saline) was given in the control group (n = 12). After delivery, pups were grossly observed for congenital malformations until the time of sacrifice (3 months) and different types of malformations and their frequency were noted and characterized.In the ASD group, congenital malformation was present in 69.9% of the pups, whereas in the control group, it was 0%. Male pups were most commonly affected (90% in males vs. only 39.72% in female pups). The tail deformity was the most common malformation found affecting 61.2% pups in the ASD group. Other malformations observed were dental malformation (3.82%), genital malformation (3.28%) and paw malformation (1.1%). Hind limb paralysis was observed in one pup. The tail anomalies were characterized as per gross appearance and location of the malformation.In this well-validated rat model of ASD, congenital malformation was quite common. It seems screening of congenital malformations should be an integral part of the management of ASD, or the case may be vice versa, i.e., in the case of a baby born with a congenital deformity, they should be screened for ASD.

p1350
aVAntidepressant treatment alters brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, but it is not well established whether BDNF can be used as a marker to prove the efficacy of antidepressant treatment. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aim at assessing the influence of antidepressant treatment on BDNF level and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score, thereby to establish the rationale of utilizing BDNF as a predictive biomarker and HDRS score as an indicator for antidepressant treatment efficacy.Search was conducted in PubMed, Science Direct, and Cochrane databases using the key words "BDNF" and "Depression" and "Antidepressants." On the basis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, studies were filtered and finally 6 randomized controlled trials were shortlisted.Comparison of serum BDNF level before and after antidepressant treatment was performed and the result showed that antidepressant treatment does not significantly affect the BDNF levels (confidence interval [CI]: -0.483 to 0.959; standard mean difference [SMD]: 0.238, P = 0.518). Egger's regression test (P = 0.455) and heterogeneity test (I(2) = 88.909%) were done. Similarly, comparison of HDRS scores before and after antidepressant treatment indicated improvement in HDRS score suggesting positive outcome (CI: 1.719 to 3.707; SMD: 2.713, P < 0.001). Egger's regression test (P = 0.1417) and heterogeneity test (I(2) = 89.843%) were performed. Publication bias was observed by funnel plot.Changes in BDNF levels do not occur uniformly for all the antidepressants. Hence, to use BDNF as a biomarker, it needs to be seen whether the same is true for all antidepressants.

Compounds showing potent antioxidant activity (CS-1 and CS-2) were investigated further for their antidepressant activity using the forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). Ascorbic acid (AA) and fluoxetine (20 mg/kg, p.o) were used as reference drugs for comparison in the antioxidant and antidepressant experiments, respectively.It was observed that CS-2 and CS-3 exhibited highest DPPH (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50]: 16.22 and 25.18 \u03bcg/mL) and ABTS (IC50: 17.2 and 28.86 \u03bcg/mL) radical scavenging activity, respectively, compared to AA (IC50: 15.73 and 16.79 \u03bcg/mL) and therefore, both CS-2 and CS-3 were tested for their antidepressant effect using FST and TST as experimental models. Pretreatment of CS-2 and CS-3 (20 mg/kg) for 10 days considerably decreased the immobility time in both the FST and TST models.The antioxidant and antidepressant effect of CS-2 and CS-3 may be attributed to the presence of azomethine linkage in the molecule.

aVBesides unparalleled benefits, highly active antiretroviral therapy is also associated with wide range of potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs), which hinders treatment adherence. The present study was thus designed to monitor and explore the pattern of occurrence of ADRs to various antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens in a tertiary care ART setup.A prospective, observational clinical study was carried out in the outpatient setting of nodal ART center of Eastern India. A total of 610 patients on various ART regimens were studied for suspected ADRs over 12 months. Adverse event history, medication history, and other relevant details were captured. Causality and severity of each reported ADR were duly assessed.32.45% patients of total study participants presented with a total of 330 ADRs. Patients from zidovudine-based regimens presented with majority of ADRs such as anemia (up to 36%), central nervous system (CNS), and gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. Tenofovir-based regimens were, however, found to be mildly safer. The combination with Efavirenz was associated with majorly CNS side effects while that of nevirapine was associated with rash and pigmentation of nails. Atazanavir boosted second-line regimens were notably associated with increased serum lipid levels followed by other GI and CNS adverse effects. Increased liver enzymes were found in atazanavir-based second-line ART.The study enables to obtain information on the incidence and pattern of ADRs associated with various antiretroviral regimens, thereby reducing its occurrence and protecting the patient population from avoidable harm. Need of intensive monitoring for ADRs in ARTs thus seems to be a mandate.

p1361
aVCurrent therapy for Glioblastoma is insufficient because of the presence of blood brain barrier. It limits the transport of essential drugs to the tumor sites. To overcome this limitation we strategized the delivery of an anticancer compound 3,3'-diindolylmethane by encapsulation in poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were tagged with a novel peptide against somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2), a potential target in glioma. The nanoformulation (27-87nm) had loading and encapsulation efficiency of 7.2% and 70% respectively. It was successfully internalized inside the glioma cells resulting in apoptosis. Furthermore, an in vivo bio-distribution study revealed the selective accumulation of the nanoformulation into rat brain tumor sites by crossing the blood brain barrier. This resulted in abrogation of epidermal growth factor receptor pathway activation in glioma cells. Our novel nanopreparation therefore shows great promise to serve as a template for targeted delivery of other therapeutics in treating GBM.

All 24 patients randomly received Botox or Neuronox in the periorbital region in a masked, randomized split-face manner, keeping the injection sites and doses uniform. The toxin preparation, injection, and clinical evaluations were done by three independent observers. Objective outcome measures included improvement in the severity of spasm, grading of the functional visual status, changes in palpebral fissure height, lagophthalmos, superficial punctate keratitis and Schirmer's test at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and upon conclusion of the effect of the toxin. Subjective outcome measures included duration of the effect and a forced choice stating which half of the face was better. Evaluations were performed through clinical measurements, external digital photography, and high-definition videography.The mean duration of relief from spasms was 3.78 months (standard deviation, 1.58 months; range, 1 to 6 months). The improvement in the objective parameters like severity of spasm and functional visual status was statistically significant at the 2-week and 6-week follow-up visits (p < 0.0001). The changes in palpebral fissure height, lagophthalmos, and superficial punctate keratitis were equally observed in both groups. At 2 and 6 weeks, three of 24 (12.5%) and one of 24 (4%) patients, respectively, reported an unequal effect between the two sides of the face, but this difference was not statistically significant. At final follow-up (conclusion of the toxin effect), patients reported equal effect with no preference for either hemiface. No statistically significant differences were found in the comparative analysis between the Neuronox and Botox groups.Neuronox and Botox are comparable in terms of their safety and efficacy in the management of BEB.

Those without associated instability were evaluated for segmental mobility, segmental angulation, facet inclination, stage of disc degeneration, and level of involvement on MRI and dynamic radiographs. Outcomes of unilateral laminotomy and cystectomy were evaluated using VAS (Visual Analogue Score), ODI (Oswestry Disability Index), and Macnabs criteria. Dynamic radiographs were performed in all cases pre- and postoperatively and at the last follow-up.Thirty patients were operated for a LISC between 2007 and 2013. The levels involved were L4-5(23), L3-4(4) and L5-S1(3). The mean facet angle was 42.6 (± 6.1) degrees. The stage of disc degeneration was scattered haphazardly across all the cases (Gr 2[17]; Gr 3[1]; Gr 4[8]; Gr 5[4]). VAS and ODI scores improved significantly in all patients. Mean follow-up was 46.5 months (36-96 months). No patient developed postoperative instability at the last follow-up.The coronal inclination of the facet joints, absence of radiological instability, and poor co-relation with stages of disc degeneration suggests the presence of adequate residual stability. In this study, stand-alone decompression for LISCs without instability had well sustained good/excellent outcomes. Fusion is recommended for LISCs with associated instability.

aVLiterature review.The aim of this review is to describe the injuries associated with sacral fractures and to analyze their impact on patient outcome.A comprehensive narrative review of the literature was performed to identify the injuries associated with sacral fractures.Sacral fractures are uncommon injuries that result from high-energy trauma, and that, due to their rarity, are frequently underdiagnosed and mistreated. Only 5% of sacral fractures occur in isolation. Injuries most often associated with sacral fractures include neurologic injuries (present in up to 50% of sacral fractures), pelvic ring disruptions, hip and lumbar spine fractures, active pelvic/ abdominal bleeding and the presence of an open fracture or significant soft tissue injury. Diagnosis of pelvic ring fractures and fractures extending to the lumbar spine are key factors for the appropriate management of sacral fractures. Importantly, associated systemic (cranial, thoracic, and abdominopelvic) or musculoskeletal injuries should be promptly assessed and addressed. These associated injuries often dictate the management and eventual outcome of sacral fractures and, therefore, any treatment algorithm should take them into consideration.Sacral fractures are complex in nature and often associated with other often-missed injuries. This review summarizes the most relevant associated injuries in sacral fractures and discusses on their appropriate management.

aVNitric oxide (NO), an endogenously produced free radical species, is an extremely important signalling molecule in several biochemical processes related to neurotransmission, neuronal communication, and vasodilation, to name a few. Other than relying on endogenous synthesis, intracellular NO delivery presents an interesting challenge to fully exploit the therapeutic potential of this gaseous molecule. We have applied a self-assembling peptide conjugate strategy to devise a construct carrying a NO-release arm, which can be activated under standard redox conditions. Consequently, a tryptophan-based peptide carrier was designed, which self-assembled in the solution phase to afford soft nanospherical structures, and released NO in Neuro2a cell line, resulting in neurite outgrowth.

Efavirenz (EFV) and Voriconazole (VRC) have been reported to affect cholesterol-24S-hydroxylase enzyme. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of EFV and VRC in experimental models of depression in mice.There was a measurement of immobility time in forced swim test and tail suspension test in which mice were previously subjected to the treatment of EFV (0.09mg/kg, orally (po)) and VRC (75mg/kg, intraperitoneally (ip)) separately for 14days. Sucrose intake was measured during stress schedule of 21days in chronic mild stress model in which mice were subjected to above mentioned drug treatment for last 14days. There was an estimation of serum total cholesterol and brain serotonin levels on day 21.The results indicated that mice treated with EFV showed a significant decrease in the immobility time and increase in sucrose intake with decrease in serum total cholesterol. Mice treated with VRC showed a significant increase in the immobility time and decrease in the sucrose intake with increase in serum total cholesterol. There was a significant increase and decrease in brain serotonin levels in mice treated with EFV and VRC respectively.The results of the present study indicates the possible anti-depressant effect of EFV and pro-depressive-like effect of VRC in specified doses in mice, raising the possibility that stimulation but not inhibition of cholesterol-24S-hydroxylase may be important in the treatment of depression.

Cases 4 and 6 underwent PDEK, whereas case 5 underwent DMEK. Epithelial debridement was performed in all cases at the time of EK, and young donor grafts were used. The main outcome measures were best spectacle-corrected visual acuity, clearance of corneal scar and haze, central corneal thickness (CCT), specular microscopy, and endothelial cell count (ECC).Postoperatively, all cases demonstrated significant improvement in visual acuity. The mean value of depth of subepithelial haze was 121±71.7 µm and 25.3 ± 19.8 µm in the preoperative and postoperative periods, respectively (p = 0.028). At the 1-month follow-up, the mean preoperative CCT of 676 ± 92.7 µm was reduced to 534.6 ± 21.1µm. At the 6-month follow-up, the mean ECC loss resulting from the procedure was 36.5 ± 10.4%.EK with epithelial debridement performed for the treatment of chronic PBK resulted in significantly improved visual acuity to a functional level, with the clearance of subepithelial fibrosis and anterior stromal scar, in most patients.

VSeventy-seven kidney paired donation transplantations at a single transplant centre in India led to an increase in living donor kidney transplantations in 2015.
p1387
aVTo ascertain the validity of kidney paired donations (KPDs) as an alternative strategy for increasing living donor kidney transplantations (LDKTs) in an LDKT-dominated transplant programme since directed kidney transplantation, ABO-incompatible or crossmatch-positive pairs are not feasible due to costs and infectious complications.This was a prospective single-centre study of 77 KPD transplantations (25 two-way, 7 three-way and 1 six-way exchange) from 1 January 2015 to 1 January 2016 of 158 registered donor recipient pairs. During this period, a total of 380 kidney transplantations [71 deceased donor kidney transplantations (DDKTs), 309 LDKTs] were performed. The reasons for opting for KPD were ABO incompatibility (n\u2009=\u200945), sensitization (n\u2009=\u200926) and better matching (n\u2009=\u20096).KPD matching was facilitated in 62% (n\u2009=\u200998) of transplants. In all, 48.7% (n\u2009=\u200977) of the transplants were completed in 2015, whereas 13.3% (n\u2009=\u200921) of the matched patients were to undergo transplant surgery in early 2016 after getting legal permission. The waiting time for KPD was shorter compared with DDKT. The death-censored graft survival and patient survival were 98.7% (n\u2009=\u200976) and 93.5% (n\u2009=\u200972), respectively. In all, 14.2% (n\u2009=\u200911) of patients had acute rejection. Match rates among sensitized (n\u2009=\u200960) and O group patients (n\u2009=\u200962) were 58.3% (n\u2009=\u200935) and 41.9% (n\u2009=\u200926), respectively. Of these, 43.3% (n\u2009=\u200926) and 29% (n\u2009=\u200918) of transplants were completed and 15% (n\u2009=\u20099) and 12.9% (n\u2009=\u20098), respectively, are waiting for legal permission.LDKT increased by 25% in 1 year in our single-centre KPD programme. Our key to success was the formation of a KPD registry, awareness and active counselling programs and developing a dedicated team.

VAcute myeloid leukemia cells require 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase for cell growth and NADPH-dependent metabolic reprogramming.
p1390
aVAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are highly dependent on glycolytic pathways to generate metabolic energy and support cell growth, hinting at specific, targetable vulnerabilities as potential novel targets for drug development. Elevated levels of NADPH, a central metabolic factor involved in redox reactions, are common in myeloid leukemia cells, but the significance or biochemical basis underlying this increase is unknown. Using a small molecule analog that efficiently inhibits NADPH-producing enzymes, we found that AML cells require NADPH homeostasis for cell growth. We also found that inhibiting NADPH production through knockdown of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) within the pentose phosphate pathway was sufficient to reduce cell growth and lactate production, a measure of metabolic reprogramming. Further, inhibition of 6PGD activity reduced NADH levels and enzymatic activity of the oxidized NADH-dependent sirtuin-1. Targeting 6PGD and NADPH production was sufficient to block growth of AML cell lines resistant to the chemotherapeutics daunorubicin and cytarabine. Importantly, stromal cell-mediated resistance to targeted inhibition of oncogenic FLT3 kinase activity by quizartinib was circumvented by 6PGD knockdown. Overall, these data suggest that the dependency of AML cells on NADPH to permit increased glycolytic flux creates a potential vulnerability of possible therapeutic benefit, since much of the enhanced production of NADPH is dependent on the activity of a single enzyme, 6PGD.

aVTo evaluate and compare the Truview PCD and C-MAC laryngoscopes to the standard Macintosh laryngoscope in paediatric patients.One hundred and fifty ASA I-II patients in the age group of 1-6 years (10-20 kg) scheduled for elective surgery were randomised into three equal groups for laryngoscopy and intubation with either Truview PCD (Group T), C-MAC (Group C) or Macintosh (Group M) laryngoscopes under general anaesthesia. Percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score, application of external laryngeal manoeuvre, time to intubation, number of attempts at intubation, failed intubations, episodes of desaturation and trauma caused were recorded and statistically analysed. A p value of <0.05 was taken as significant.POGO scores were significantly better with Truview PCD as compared with C-MAC and Macintosh laryngoscopes (94.7 ± 12.9/82 ± 25.0/85.1 ± 17.1; p < 0.01). There were no failed attempts, episodes of desaturation or trauma in any of the patients. The mean intubation time taken was 19.2 s in group T, 12.3 s in group C and 10.7 s in group M, respectively. There is a statistically significant difference among groups (p < 0.01). Eight patients in group T, 21 out of 50 patients in group C and 19 out of 50 patients in group M needed OELM, respectively. There is significant difference among the groups (p < 0.01) CONCLUSION: Using Truview PCD to assist intubation offers excellent view field of glottic opening after OLEM and the mean time taken is less than 20 s. The Truview PCD tool is suitable for paediatric patients.

The definitions given by Asian Pacific association for the study of liver (APASL) and American association for the study of liver (AASLD) and European association for the study of liver (EASL) working group have fundamental deficiencies and contradictions and do not encompass all patients with ACLF seen in the East and West. Although the World Gastroenterology Organisation (WGO) working party attempted to provide an improved definition but this too is not appropriate. In this article, we have compared the various definitions of ACLF given by APASL, EASL-AASLD and WGO and suggest a comprehensive definition for prospective collection of data on ACLF.

VIn Situ Splitting of the Cadaver Liver for Two Adult Recipients by LDLT Technique.
p1401
aVTo expand the donor pool, split liver transplantation is conventionally performed for one adult and one pediatric recipient. Application of this technique for two adult recipients can produce remarkable impact on the waiting list. Proper donor and recipient selection is crucial for the favorable outcome following full-right and full-left liver split. Right lobe adult to adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is essentially a full right and full left split. However, LDLT techniques have not been used for full right and left split.We performed in situ splitting of the whole liver using LDLT techniques from a hemodynamically stable young deceased donor and transplanted into two adult recipients, both with model for end-stage liver disease score of 17. The transection was carried out through the midplane of liver, generating a right lobe and a left lobe graft.Both the recipients had uneventful postoperative recovery. At ten months of follow up, both the recipients are doing well with good liver function.Based on the concept of living related liver transplantation, our case explores the technical feasibility of full-right and full-left in situ liver split.

We report our experience of 24-week therapy with sofosbuvir (SOF) and ribavirin (RBV) in post-LT recurrent HCV in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) setting in South Asia.Data from all patients treated for post-transplantation HCV recurrence in a single center were analyzed. Treatment regimen was 24 weeks of SOF 400 mg daily and RBV (starting at 800 mg daily, increased as tolerated). Sustained virological response (SVR) was assessed 12 weeks and 24 weeks after completion of treatment.63 patients (median age 52 [range 30-69] years; 80% males) were treated. Most (76.2%) were treatment experienced and predominant HCV genotype was 3 (77.7%) followed by 1 (20.6%). Median transient elastography (Fibroscan) score was 7 (range 3-11) kPa and none of the patients had cirrhosis. SVR12 was achieved in 60 of 63 patients (95.2%) while SVR24 was noted in 59 (93.7%). SVR12 rates were as good in genotype-3 as in genotype-1. Older age, longer period after transplantation, higher Fibroscan value and higher need for erythropoietin were likely to be associated with relapse. Adverse effects were noted in 34 patients and weakness and fatigue were the commonest side effects. Significant drop in hemoglobin (<8 g/dL) was seen in 6 patients.SOF + RBV combination therapy for 24 weeks was safe and effective in treatment of for post-LT recurrent HCV in a single LT center and remains relevant due to its low cost and lack of drug interactions.

VCentrifugal microfluidics for sorting immune cells from whole blood.
p1410
aVSorting and enumeration of immune cells from blood are critical operations involved in many clinical applications. Conventional methods for sorting and counting immune cells from blood, such as flow cytometry and hemocytometers, are tedious, inaccurate, and difficult for implementation for point-of-care (POC) testing. Herein we developed a microscale centrifugal technology termed Centrifugal Microfluidic Chip (CMC) capable of sorting immune cells from blood and in situ cellular analysis in a laboratory setting. Operation of the CMC entailed a blood specimen layered on a density gradient medium and centrifuged in microfluidic channels where immune cell subpopulations could rapidly be sorted into distinct layers according to their density differentials. We systematically studied effects of different blocking molecules for surface passivation of the CMC. We further demonstrated the applicability of CMCs for rapid separation of minimally processed human whole blood without affecting immune cell viability. Multi-color imaging and analysis of immune cell distributions and enrichment such as recovery and purity rates of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were demonstrated using CMCs. Given its design and operation simplicity, portability, blood cell sorting efficiency, and in situ cellular analysis capability, the CMC holds promise for blood-based diagnosis and disease monitoring in POC applications.

VEstablishing Fascin over-expression as a strategic regulator of neoplastic aggression and lymph node metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinoma tumor microenvironment.
p1413
aVOral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has an aggressive behaviour with high incidence of nodal metastasis, even in the early stages, leading to poor prognosis. For progression and metastasis of cancers, the dominant element considered is cell motility. Fascin, an actin-binding protein has emerged as a protein of general importance for a diverse set of cell protrusions with functions in cell adhesion, cell interactions, and cell migration. The role of Fascin in various carcinomas, including aggressive behaviour in OSCC has been documented, but its role as a key regulator in lymph nodes metastasis is yet to be validated.This study was piloted to evaluate and correlate Fascin expression in OSCC lymph nodes and understand the role of Fascin in contemptuous Lesional tissue, as a predictor of survival. A retrospective study designed with 40 archival OSCC cases was included as sample, 20 each of both lymph node metastasis +ve (Group 1) and -ve (Group 2) groups. All the participants were smokeless tobacco user and had tumor located at gingivo-buccal complex.We established that Fascin over-expression in lymph nodes were significantly associated with clinico-histopathological parameters like staging (p=0.01), tumor size (cT) (p=0.03) and differentiation; and furthermore it was highly significant in correlation to nodal status (cN) (*p\u22640.001). Fascin over-expression in lymph node metastasis positive cases correlated with that of Fascin expression in contemptuous Lesional tissue signifying its role in promoting aggressive progression and metastasis. This association was found to be statistically significant (p value=0.05). Overall Survival Analysis of both lymph node metastasis +ve and -ve groups assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis (taking death and recurrence into consideration) showed patients with high Fascin expression (in lymph node and Lesional tissue) had shorter overall survival than patients who had no to weak Fascin expression.Our findings thereby establish Fascin expression as a regulator of metastasis in OSCC tumor microenvironment and predictor of survival.

aVAlbeit the fact that asafotida is a popular kitchen spice and Indian folklore medicine for gut disorders, its consumption at physiologically relevant dosage is greatly challenged by the unpleasant flavor characteristics. Herein we report a green approach to derive stable powder formulations of asafoetida gum with minimized taste and odor suitable for dietary applications and gut health-related disorders. Employing a water based ultrasound mediated gel-phase dispersion of asafoetida gum on fenugreek derived soluble galactomannan fibre matrix. Microencapsulated particles (1 ± 0.3 \u03bcm) of asafoetida was prepared as water dispersible free flowing powder (Asafin). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), accelerated stability and in vitro dissolution studies confirmed the stability, sustained release and microencapsulated structure of Asafin. Further investigations revealed significant (p < 0.01) reduction in acetic acid-induced writings and inhibition of ethanol-induced ulcer (94.1%) in rats orally administered with Asafin at 250 mg kg(-1) b.w. Asafin also exhibited anti-inflammatory effects (p < 0.01), in acute and chronic paw edema mice models.

V\u03b1-lipoic acid inhibits oxidative stress in testis and attenuates testicular toxicity in rats exposed to carbimazole during embryonic period.
p1421
aVThe aim of this study was to evaluate the probable protective effect of \u03b1-lipoic acid against testicular toxicity in rats exposed to carbimazole during the embryonic period. Time-mated pregnant rats were exposed to carbimazole from the embryonic days 9-21. After completion of the gestation period, all the rats were allowed to deliver pups and weaned. At postnatal day 100, F1 male pups were assessed for the selected reproductive endpoints. Gestational exposure to carbimazole decreased the reproductive organ indices, testicular daily sperm count, epididymal sperm variables viz., sperm count, viable sperm, motile sperm and HOS-tail coiled sperms. Significant decrease in the activity levels of 3\u03b2- and 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases and expression of StAR mRNA levels with a significant increase in the total cholesterol levels were observed in the testis of experimental rats over the controls. These events were also accompanied by a significant reduction in the serum testosterone levels in CBZ exposed rats, indicating reduced steroidogenesis. In addition, the deterioration of the testicular architecture and reduced fertility ability were noticed in the carbimazole exposed rats. Significant reduction in the activity levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase and reduced glutathione content with a significant increase in the levels of lipid peroxidation were observed in the testis of carbimazole exposed rats over the controls. Conversely, supplementation of \u03b1-lipoic acid (70 mg/Kg bodyweight) ameliorated the male reproductive health in rats exposed to carbimazole during the embryonic period as evidenced by enhanced reproductive organ weights, selected sperm variables, testicular steroidogenesis, and testicular enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. To conclude, diminished testicular antioxidant balance associated with reduced spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis might be responsible for the suppressed reproduction in rats exposed to the carbimazole transplacentally. On the other hand, \u03b1-lipoic acid through its antioxidant and steroidogenic properties mitigated testicular toxicity which eventually restored the male reproductive health of carbimazole-exposed rats.

aVThe Nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor2 (Nrf2), a master regulator of redox homoeostasis, is a key transcription factor regulating a wide array of genes for antioxidant and detoxification enzymes. It protects organs from various kinds of toxic insults. On the other hand, activation of Nrf2 is also correlated with cancer progression and chemoresistance. Downregulation of Nrf2 activity has attracted an increasing amount of attention as it may provide an alternative cancer therapy. In this review, we examine recent studies on roles of Nrf2 in several pathophysiological conditions emphasising cancer. We discuss elaborately the current knowledge on Nrf2 regulation including KEAP1-dependent and KEAP1-independent cascades. KEAP1/Nrf2 system is a master regulator of cellular response against a variety of environmental stresses. We also highlight several tightly controlled regulations of Nrf2 by numerous proteins, small molecules, toxic metals, etc. In addition, we evaluate the possible therapeutic approaches of increasing chemosensitivity via modulating Nrf2 signaling.

Vp-Benzoquinone initiates non-invasive urothelial cancer through aberrant tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, MAP kinase activation and cell cycle deregulation: Prevention by vitamin C.
p1427
aVAccording to WHO classification system, non-invasive urothelial carcinoma represents urothelial carcinoma in situ (CIS) and dysplasia. Dysplastic urothelium often progresses to CIS that further advances to urothelial carcinoma (UC). The strongest risk factor for UC is cigarette smoking. However, the pathogenesis of cigarette smoke (CS)-induced UC is poorly understood. Earlier we had shown that p-benzoquinone (p-BQ), a major toxic quinone derived from p-benzosemiquinone of CS in vivo, is a causative factor for various CS-induced diseases. Here, using a guinea pig model we showed that prolonged treatment with p-BQ led to non-invasive UC, specifically carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the renal pelvis and dysplasia in the ureter and bladder. The mechanisms of carcinogenesis were p-BQ-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis that were later suppressed and followed by activation of epidermal growth factor receptor, aberrant phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues, activation of MAP kinase pathway and persistent growth signaling. This was accompanied by deregulation of cell cycle as shown by marked decrease in the expression of p21(waf1/cip1) and cyclin D1 proteins as well as hyperphosphorylation of pRb. UC has been characterised by histopathology and immunohistochemistry showing aberrant CK20, increased Ki-67, and marked p53 nuclear immunopositivity with uniformly negative labelling of CD44. Oral supplementation of vitamin C (30 mg/kg body weight/day) prevented CIS of the renal pelvis and dysplasia in the ureter and bladder. Since majority of non-invasive UC progresses to invasive cancer with increased risk of mortality, our preclinical study might help to devise effective strategies for early intervention of the disease.

aVHomalium zeylanicum (Gardner) Benth. (Flacourtiaceae) is a medicinal plant useful in controlling rheumatism, inflammation and diabetes. The objective of this work evaluates in vitro antioxidant, antidiabetic, and antiinflammatory properties of hydroalcohol extract of bark of H. zeylanicum (HAHZ). It also describes isolation and structure determination of lucidenic acid A, which is the first report in this plant. In order to explain the role of antioxidant principles, DPPH, nitric oxide, hydroxyl, superoxide and metal chelating assays were performed. Antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory activities were investigated by quantifying \u03b1-amylase, \u03b1-glucosidase and protein denaturation inhibitory activities of HAHZ. Biochemical estimations were performed. The chemical structure of the triterpenoid was elucidated using (1)H, (13)C NMR and high resolution-MS. IC50 of DPPH, nitric oxide, hydroxyl, superoxide and metal chelating activities were of 36.23 ± 0.27, 40.11 ± 0.32, 35.23 ± 0.57, 43.34 ± 0.22 and 11.54 ± 0.08 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. IC50 of \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase activities were 29.12 ± 0.54, and 18.55 ± 0.15 \u03bcg/mL. Total phenolic and total flavonoid contents were recorded at 233.65 mg/g GAE and 172.7 mg/g QE. Regarding kinetic behaviour, HAHZ showed competitive inhibition on \u03b1-glucosidase and mixed competitive inhibition on \u03b1-amylase. Lucidenic acid A was confirmed by spectroscopic studies. Anti-inflammatory activity of lucidenic acid A was determined by using protein denaturation assay with IC50 13 \u03bcg/mL but HAHZ showed 30.34 ± 0.13 \u03bcg/mL. Phenols and flavonoids could be attributed to inhibition of intestinal carbohydrases for anti-diabetic activities whereas triterpenoids could be responsible for anti-inflammatory activity of H. zeylanicum.

p1433
aVCarbamates, most commonly used pesticides in agricultural practices, have been reported to produce free radicals causing deleterious effects in animals. The present study was designed to assess the carbofuran induced oxidative stress in rat liver slices in vitro and also to evaluate protective role of vitamin C by incubating them in Krebs-Ringer HEPES Buffer (KRHB) containing incubation media (Williams medium E (WME) supplemented with glucose and antibiotics) with different concentrations of carbofuran. The results demonstrated that carbofuran caused significant increase in lipid peroxidation and inhibition in the activity of hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) in concentration dependent manner. The data with incubation medium reflected that carbofuran at lowest concentration caused an increase in SOD activity followed by its inhibition at higher concentration. Carbofuran treatment caused inhibition in the activity of catalase in liver slices and WME incubation medium. Pre-incubation of liver slices and the WME media with vitamin C restored the values of biochemical indices tested. The results indicated that carbofuran might induce oxidative stress in hepatocytes. The pretreatment with vitamin C may offer hepatoprotection from toxicity of pesticide at low concentration only.

aVJaundice in malaria is multifactorial. Plasmodium falciparum causes malarial hepatopathy in around 2.5% of cases. The spectrum of hepatic dysfunction in patients with malaria varies from mild clinical and biochemical abnormalities to fulminant hepatic failure, although hepatic encephalopathy almost never occurs. We undertook this study in order to estimate the magnitude of hepatopathy in malaria, and study the associated clinical features, complications and outcome of patients.We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients with acute malaria hospitalized from between 2009 and 2015. We compared the clinical features, demographic parameters, laboratory findings, complications and outcome of patients with and without hepatopathy.Hepatopathy was observed in 22% (215/978) (n=215) of those with acute malaria (n=978) due to mono-infection by Plasmodium vivax (56.7%) or P. falciparum (38.1%) and their co-infection (5.1%). The age of the patients ranged from 2 to 96 years, with male preponderance (63.2%). Bleeding events, thrombocytopenia, total leukocyte count, levels of transaminases (aspartate transaminases, alanine transaminases), serum bilirubin, serum albumin and serum creatinine, duration of hospitalization and mortality were significantly greater in patients with malarial hepatopathy (p<0.05). Also, hepatopathy and renal dysfunction were significantly associated (OR 5.35; p<0.001).Hepatopathy is a serious complication of malaria, and is associated with other organ dysfunction and greater mortality.

The objectives of the present in vitro study were to evaluate the efficacy of bioactive pectic polysaccharides (CCPS) of MC along with another well-known bioactive compound curcumin in the abrogation of hepatocellular oxidative stress persuaded by sodium arsenite. Electrozymographic method was developed for the assessment of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities of liver tissues maintained under an in vitro system. A significant association of CCPS of MC in combination with curcumin was found in the alleviation of oxidative stress induced by sodium arsenite in liver slice. Generated data pointed out that CCPS of MC and curcumin separately or in combination can offer significant protection against alterations in malondialdehyde (MDA), conjugated diene (CD) and antioxidative defense (SOD, CAT) markers. Furthermore, results of hepatic cell DNA degradation strongly supported that both these co-administrations have efficacy in preventing cellular damage. This is the first information of extracted polysaccharides from MC preventing arsenic induced damage in a liver slice of rat.

VPatients with Primary Immunodeficiencies Are a Reservoir of Poliovirus and a Risk to Polio Eradication.
p1448
aVImmunodeficiency-associated vaccine-derived polioviruses (iVDPVs) have been isolated from primary immunodeficiency (PID) patients exposed to oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). Patients may excrete poliovirus strains for months or years; the excreted viruses are frequently highly divergent from the parental OPV and have been shown to be as neurovirulent as wild virus. Thus, these patients represent a potential reservoir for transmission of neurovirulent polioviruses in the post-eradication era. In support of WHO recommendations to better estimate the prevalence of poliovirus excreters among PIDs and characterize genetic evolution of these strains, 635 patients including 570 with primary antibody deficiencies and 65 combined immunodeficiencies were studied from 13 OPV-using countries. Two stool samples were collected over 4\u2009days, tested for enterovirus, and the poliovirus positive samples were sequenced. Thirteen patients (2%) excreted polioviruses, most for less than 2\u2009months following identification of infection. Five (0.8%) were classified as iVDPVs (only in combined immunodeficiencies and mostly poliovirus serotype 2). Non-polio enteroviruses were detected in 30 patients (4.7%). Patients with combined immunodeficiencies had increased risk of delayed poliovirus clearance compared to primary antibody deficiencies. Usually, iVDPV was detected in subjects with combined immunodeficiencies in a short period of time after OPV exposure, most for less than 6\u2009months. Surveillance for poliovirus excretion among PID patients should be reinforced until polio eradication is certified and the use of OPV is stopped. Survival rates among PID patients are improving in lower and middle income countries, and iVDPV excreters are identified more frequently. Antivirals or enhanced immunotherapies presently in development represent the only potential means to manage the treatment of prolonged excreters and the risk they present to the polio endgame.

VAtypical osteomyelitis and concurrent septic arthritis due to Salmonella in immunocompetent children.
p1451
aVSalmonella osteomyelitis in immunocompromised individuals with sickle cell anaemia is well documented. Its occurrence in immunocompetent children is rare.All pus culture positive cases of salmonella typhi between the period 2009 to 2014 were reviewed and only those children without sickle cell disease or trait were considered further.Eighty five patients had positive cultures. Of these only three children had culture positive Salmonella septic arthritis in the absence of sickle cell disease. Two children had shoulder septic arthritis while one had hip septic arthritis.Our case series highlights the possibility of salmonella typhi osteomyelitis in immunocompetent individuals. Clinicians should be aware of this presentation which is usually delayed due to the atypical organism and lack of clinical response in the initial stages, as disastrous sequelae of septic arthritis may result if prompt treatment is not initiated in time.

VExperience of supracondylar cheveron osteotomy for genu valgum in 115 adolescent knees.
p1454
aVMedial close wedge Coventry type osteotomy is commonly performed procedure for adoloscent Genu valgum. However this osteotomy has some inherent problems, a wedge resection causes shortening of affected site. An additional plate for stabilization causes increase in soft tissue dissection and surgical time. A cheveron osteotomy is an alternative procedure, not requiring any internal fixation due to its inherent stability. We started this study with aim to analyze the results of Cheveron osteotomy, to see if the osteotomy was stable enough without implants, time required for healing of osteotomy, post-operative range of motion, limb length discrepancy and to evaluate any other complication.This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of cheveron osteotomy in cases with genu valgum in our department from 2005 to 2012. 75 children with 115 knee deformities were included in the study. Patients were followed upto minimum 3 years post surgery. Clinical and radiological assessment was done on all subsequent visits.Preoperative mean valgus angle was 21° (12-30°) and mean inter malleolar distance was 12.3 cm(11-21 cm). The mean post-operative angle was 6.5° and mean intermalleolar distance was 5.6 cm. The difference was statistically significant. The mean tourniquet time was 26 min and mean surgical time including plaster cast application was 38 min. Mean blood loss was 75 ml. The mean time to union was 10.3 weeks.Supracondylar cheveron osteotomy is simple, stable, low cost osteotomy for surgical correction of genu valgum. The osteotomy provides excellent clinical, radiological and functional results in short surgical time and has an added advantage of omitting the need of second surgery.

VEndovascular management of traumatic pseudoaneurysm: Short & long term outcomes.
p1457
aVPseudoaneurysms as result of orthopaedic injuries are a known clinical entity. But with increase in operative interventions and use of implants, its incidence is bound to increase. It is important to detect this complication at the earliest to avoid any limb or life threatening problems. Selective angiography is a minimally invasive technique to pin point the diagnosis and at the same time allow for therapeutic embolization/stenting of the pseudo aneurysm.A retrospective review of inpatients from January 2007 to January 2013 requiring transarterial embolization/stenting for pseudoaneurysm in the limbs. All patients had evidence of pseudoaneurysm as proved by radiological findings. Angiographic intervention in a cath lab was performed, following which patients were monitored for morbidity and mortality benefits on short and long term follow up.Out of the total 13 patients; 7 adults and 1 child underwent embolisation with polyvinyl alcohol particle/soft metal coil, whereas the remaining 5 adults underwent revascularisation with covered stent. The mean age of patients in our case series was 41.92 ± 18.89 years. The mean follow up period of the group was 14.61 ± 12.21 months. All but one patients showed significant clinical improvement with endovascular management with no procedure related mortality.Endovascular management is the modality of choice in comparison to other procedures for traumatic pseudoaneurysms in both paediatric and adult patients.

p1460
aVPretensioning is usually done using two methods - manual cyclical loading and using tensioner with a tendon board. Both the methods are being used with little knowledge about the superiority of either method. This study was done with the objective of trying to find out the better method.A total of 50 patients were selected for the above mentioned study who were randomised into each of the two groups using chit system - In group A patients, cyclical loading was done by twenty times full flexion -extension movements but in group B patients, the graft was placed on a tensioner with 15 pounds tension for 10 minutes. All patients were operated by the same surgeon. The patients were put on a strict rehabilitation protocol. Patients were allowed to bear weight as tolerated. Patients returned for follow up at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. At each visit patients were followed with Lysholm's Score and ROLIMETER reading.The ROLIMETER reading and Lysholm's score were seen to improve from preoperative to postoperative period and improved further over time with the progress of the rehabilitation protocol in both the groups. When compared to each other Group A i.e. patients pretensioned with cyclical loading had better Lysholm scores and ROLIMETER readings with the difference being statistically significant at all time periods except at 1 year when the difference between the ROLIMETER readings in the two groups were no more significant, though the difference of the Lysholms score was still found to be statistically significant.It was concluded in this study that cyclical loading is a better method of pretensioning in ACL reconstruction than tensioner on tendon board with 15 pounds of tension for 10 minutes.

VSurgical management of pelvic bone sarcoma with internal hemipelvectomy: Oncologic and Functional outcomes.
p1463
aVThe management of pelvic sarcoma is challenging and goals of surgery are adequate oncologic local control, maintenance of optimum function with good quality of life.We have evaluated the results of internal hemipelvecotmy including age, type of resection, reconstruction, radiotherapy or chemotherapy. From 2010 to 2016, 23 patients with pelvic bone tumors (13 with Ewing's sarcoma, 9 with Osteosarcoma, 1 with chondrosarcoma) were treated by surgical resection.The mean follow-up was 18 months (0.5-5) years. In 12 patients reconstruction was performed and 11 were without reconstruction. A total of 3 patients (13%) had an infection develop at a mean follow up of 1 month. Surgical debridement's and antibiotics in three patients led to complete recovery. One patient had sciatic nerve injury.One patient had injury to femoral vein; was treated with femoral vein reconstruction. Two patients (9%) developed a local recurrence and were treated with best supportive treatment. Distal pulmonary metastases were seen in four patients and treated with supportive treatment. Five-year disease-specific survival rates of all patients were 83%. The mean functional MSTS score was 18(14-24).Proper selection of patients, preopertive planning and wide surgical margins with reconstruction provides good functional outcomes following internal hemipelvectomy. The surgical site infection and flap necrosis tend to be minor complication and can be managed leading to optimal outcomes and justifies the need for this complex surgery. The oncological and functional outcome after internal hemipelvectomy suggests that it's an effective method for treatment of patients with pelvic sarcomas.

VMidterm radiologic and functional outcomes of minimally-invasive fixation of unstable pelvic fractures using anterior internal fixator(INFIX) and percutaneous iliosacral screws.
p1466
aVAnterior pelvic external fixation is associated with pin site infections, aseptic loosening with loss of reduction, frame bulkiness hindering patient mobilization and consequent difficulties in inpatient nursing. We performed a single-center prospective series to evaluate the feasibility, safety, limitations and midterm radiologic and functional outcomes of an alternative minimally invasive pelvic internal fixation technique using an anterior subcutaneous pelvic internal fixator (INFIX) and percutaneous iliosacral screws in unstable pelvic ring fractures.Fifteen consecutive patients with vertically and/or rotationally unstable pelvic fractures, presenting to a Level-1 trauma center were treated with closed reduction, appropriate posterior stabilization with percutaneous iliosacral screws and anterior INFIX application. Outcomes were analyzed with respect to the quality of fracture reduction (Matta's radiologic criteria), ease of inpatient nursing, patient mobility and comfort, functional outcomes at final follow-up (Majeed score, SF-12 score), social reintegration and complications.Most common injury pattern was AO/OTA type 61-C pelvic fracture in thirteen patients. Mean procedure time and intra-operative blood loss were, 57.1+/-4.9 min (range,51-68 min) and 115.3+/-26.7 ml (range,80-170 ml) respectively. Mean follow-up was 34.9+/-4.1 months (range,31-42 months). Fracture reduction was excellent in twelve and good in three patients (Matta's criteria). Functional outcomes were excellent in eight and good in seven patients (Majeed score). Mean SF-12 scores for physical and mental health were 48.58+/-5.61 and 50.89+/-3.97 respectively. Thirteen patients returned to their pre-injury jobs. All fifteen patients reintegrated into society without any restrictions. INFIX was removed at a mean post-operative period of 7.3+/-1.5 months (range,5.5-11 months). Complications included, lateral femoral cutaneous nerve irritation(n = 1), superficial wound infection(n = 1) and loss of reduction(n = 2).Minimally invasive pelvic stabilization using INFIX and percutaneous iliosacral screws is easy to learn and apply, achieves good fracture reduction and definitive stabilization with minimum complications and offers excellent functional outcomes at a minimum follow-up of 31 months.Level IV.

VGPCR Signaling in C. elegans and Its Implications in Immune Response.
p1469
aVThe ability to sense environmental cues is central to the survival of living organisms. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are, by far, the most diverse class of sensory receptors and play an important role in surveillance. As Caenorhabditis elegans lives in soil and feeds on bacteria, it must have strategies to differentiate between nutritious vs pathogenic bacteria. In C. elegans, lacking professional immune cells, GPCRs play a very important role in defense responses, for survival against pathogens. Here, we review a rich body of research to show that C. elegans uses GPCRs in different tissues for immune surveillance, immune homeostasis, as well as behavioral responses. Nematode sensory neurons and GPCRs can sense both pathogen-associated molecules as well as damage-associated molecular patterns during infection. Both fight and flight responses, activated upon exposure to pathogens, are driven by GPCRs and trimeric G proteins in the sensory neurons.

VPefloxacin as a surrogate marker for quinolone susceptibility in Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi & Paratyphi A in India.
p1474
aVThe emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones in enteric fever despite the pathogen being susceptible by in vitro laboratory results, led to repeated changes in Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) guidelines for this class of antibiotics to have specific and sensitive interpretative criteria. In 2015, CLSI added pefloxacin disk diffusion criteria as a surrogate marker for fluoroquinolone susceptibility. This study was carried out to evaluate the use of pefloxacin as a surrogate marker for ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and levofloxacin susceptibility in clinical isolates of Salmonella Typhi and S. Paratyphi A.A total of 412 strains of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A were studied for pefloxacin disk diffusion test as a surrogate marker for susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and levofloxacin as per CLSI and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines. Molecular mechanisms of resistance to fluoroquinolones were also determined and correlated with pefloxacin susceptibility breakpoints.Of the total 412 strains, 34 were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and 33 each to levofloxacin and ofloxacin using CLSI minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. There was a positive correlation between MICs with correlation coefficients 0.917, 0.896 and 0.958 for the association between ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and ofloxacin and levofloxacin, respectively (P <0.001). The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of pefloxacin as a surrogate marker using ciprofloxacin MIC as a gold standard were 100, 99.5 and 94.4 per cent, while 100, 99.2 and 91.7 per cent taking ofloxacin and levofloxacin MIC as gold standard. Mutations in target genes correlated with the pefloxacin susceptibility results.Our results showed that pefloxacin served as a good surrogate marker for the detection of susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and levofloxacin in S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A. Further studies are required to confirm these findings.

p1477
aVShigella dysenteriae is one of the most virulent pathogens causing bacillary dysentery and is responsible for high mortality in infants. To reduce the load of antibiotic therapy for treating shigellosis, this study was carried out to assess the ex vivo effect of novel probiotic lactobacilli, isolated from infant's stool samples, on killing S. dysenteriae type 1 residing in the rat macrophages.Stool samples from infants were collected, processed for the isolation of lactobacilli and screened for the probiotic attributes (acid tolerance, bile tolerance, ability to adhere intestinal cells and anti-S. dysenteriae activity). The effect of cell-free supernatant of lactobacilli on Shigella- infected macrophages in terms of phagocytic ability, extent of lipid peroxidation, nitrite, superoxide dismutase and glutathione levels was evaluated.Based on the probiotic attributes, three lactobacilli were isolated from the stool samples of infants. Using classical and molecular tools, these isolates were identified as Lactobacillus pentosus, L. Paraplantarum and L. rhamnosus. All the three lactobacilli had the ability to kill intramacrophage S. dysentriae type 1. The anti-Shigella activity of the probiotic lactobacilli was attributed to increased antioxidative ability and decreased free radical production by the infected macrophages.Probiotic cocktail of L. pentosus, L. paraplantarum and L. rhamnosus showed ex vivo killing of S. dysenteriae residing inside the rat macrophages significantly. This cocktail has the potential to be used as a natural alternative for treating S. dysenteriae infection, especially in infants, however, further studies need to be done to confirm these finding in vivo.

p1480
aVDifferential diagnosis of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) from other acute febrile illnesses with haemorrhagic manifestation is challenging in India. Nosocomial infection is a significant mode of transmission due to exposure of healthcare workers to blood and body fluids of infected patients. Being a risk group 4 virus, laboratory confirmation of infection is not widely available. In such a situation, early identification of potential CCHF patients would be useful in limiting the spread of the disease. The objective of this study was to retrospectively analyse clinical and laboratory findings of CCHF patients that might be useful in early detection of a CCHF case in limited resource settings.Retrospective analysis of clinical and laboratory data of patients suspected to have CCHF referred for diagnosis from Gujarat and Rajasthan States of India (2014-2015) was done. Samples were tested using CCHF-specific real time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and IgM ELISA.Among the 69 patients referred, 21 were laboratory confirmed CCHF cases of whom nine had a history of occupational exposure. No clustering of cases was noted. Platelet count cut-off for detection of positive cases by receiver operating characteristic curve was 21.5×10[9]/l with sensitivity 82.4 per cent and specificity 82.1 per cent. Melaena was a significant clinical presentation in confirmed positive CCHF patients.The study findings suggest that in endemic areas thrombocytopenia and melaena may be early indicators of CCHF. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

VMALDI-TOF mass spectrometry: An emerging tool for unequivocal identification of non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli.
p1483
aVMatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been instrumental in revolutionizing microbiological identification, especially in high-throughput laboratories. It has enabled the identification of organisms like non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB), which has been a challenging task using conventional methods alone. In this study an attempt was made to validate MALDI-TOF MS for the identification of clinical isolates of each of the three most common NFGNB, other than Pseudomonas spp., taking molecular methods as the gold standard.One hundred and fifty clinical isolates of NFGNB, confirmed by molecular methods such as Acinetobacter baumannii[oxa-51 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)], Burkholderia cepacia complex (expanded multilocus sequence typing) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (species-specific PCR), were taken. Isolated colonies from fresh cultures of all 150 isolates were smeared onto ground steel plate, with and without formic acid extraction step. The identification was carried out using MALDI-TOF MS Biotyper database.A concordance of 100 and 73.33 per cent was found between the molecular techniques and MALDI-TOF MS system in the identification of these isolates up to genus and species levels, respectively. Using a cut-off of 1.9 for reliable identification, rate of species identification rose to 82.66 per cent. Principal component analysis dendrogram and cluster analysis further increased discrimination of isolates.Our findings showed MALDI-TOF MS-based identification of NFGNB as a good, robust method for high-throughput laboratories.

VRole of inducers in detection of blaPDC-mediated oxyimino-cephalosporin resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
p1486
aVPseudomonas aeruginosa possessing chromosomally inducible blaPDCalong with other intrinsic mechanism causes infection with high mortality rate. It is difficult to detect inducible AmpC enzymes in this organism and is usually overlooked by routine testing that may lead to therapeutic failure. Therefore, three different inducers were evaluated in the present study to assess their ability of induction of blaPDCin P. aeruginosa.A total of 189 consecutive Pseudomonas isolates recovered from different clinical specimens (November 2011-April 2013) were selected for the study. Isolates were screened with cefoxitin for AmpC \u03b2-lactamases and confirmed by modified three-dimensional extract test (M3DET). Inductions were checked using three inducers, namely, clavulanic acid, cefoxitin and imipenem along with ceftazidime. Molecular screening of AmpC \u03b2-lactamase genes was performed by PCR assay. Antimicrobial susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined, and repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR of all blaPDCharbouring isolates was performed.Inducible phenotype was observed in 42 (24.3%) of 97 (56%) isolates confirmed by M3DET. Among these, 22 isolates harboured chromosomal blaPDCgene, and cocarriage of both chromosomal and plasmid-mediated blaAmpC genes was observed in seven isolates. Cefoxitin-ceftazidime-based test gave good sensitivity and specificity for detecting inducible AmpC enzymes. Isolates harbouring blaPDCshowed high MIC against all tested cephalosporins and monobactam. DNA fingerprinting of these isolates showed 22 different clones of P. aeruginosa.P. aeruginosa harbouring inducible (chromosomal) and plasmid-mediated AmpC \u03b2-lactamase is a matter of concern as it may limit therapeutic option. Using cefoxitin-ceftazidime-based test is simple and may be used for detecting inducible AmpC \u03b2-lactamase amongst P. aeruginosa.

aVOral cavity carcinoma is the most common cancer in Indian population. Metastatic nodal disease is the most important prognostic factor for oral cancers. In head and neck cancers with clinically N0 neck, standard selective neck dissection is performed by protecting the spinal accessory nerve to remove level IIA & IIB lymph nodes. The purpose of this study was to analyze the significance of level IIB dissection in patients of oral cavity cancer who underwent primary surgery with functional neck dissection. Two hundred ten patients with clinically N0 neck underwent neck dissection, where level IIB lymph nodes were dissected, labelled and processed separately. Among 210 patients of clinically N0 neck, 168 patients were pathologically N0 (80 %). Out of remaining 42 (20 %), 36 (17.14 %) were pN1 and 6 (2.86 %) were pN2. Among those with pN1 (36), level IB was involved in 24 patients (66.67 %) and level IIA was involved in 12 patients (33.33 %). Only 2 patients had involvement of level IIB lymph nodes. Among 6 patients of pN2 disease, 4 patients had simultaneous involvement of level IB and level IIA lymph nodes. Remaining 2 patients had isolated involvement of level III lymph nodes. Thus only 2 patients (< 1 %) out of 210 clinically N0 oral squamous cell carcinoma showed level IIB lymph node involvement. Thus we conclude that a frozen section of level 2a is advisable to decide the need for level 2b node dissection in clinically N0 neck as the sensitivity of clinical evaluation is extremely low.

aVWeight gain has long been recognized as a side-effect of atypical antipsychotic drugs. Numerous new approaches have been tried for prevention of weight gain, the H2 blockers being one of them. The study was conducted with the aim to evaluate the efficacy of ranitidine in olanzapine-induced weight gain at two fixed doses of 150 and 300\u2009mg\u2009day(-1) .Seventy-five inpatients with an ICD-10-DCR diagnosis of schizophrenia as their first episode were randomized into three groups of 25 patients each, receiving 1-50\u2009mg\u2009day(-1) ranitidine, 300\u2009mg\u2009day(-1) ranitidine and third group receiving only olanzapine. Their weight and body mass index (BMI) were measured at baseline and at intervals of 4 and 8 weeks.All patients were comparable with respect to their weight and BMI at baseline. When a change in the weight and BMI was assessed at 4 and 8 weeks from baseline, no significant difference was observed between the three groups.Ranitidine at doses of 150 and 300\u2009mg\u2009day(-1) when combined with olanzapine was ineffective in attenuating olanzapine-induced weight gain. The likely reasons could be the use of low doses for a shorter period of time, or mechanisms other than H2 receptors might play an important role in weight gain.

aVExisting medication systems for the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM) are inconvenient and troublesome for effective and safe delivery of drugs to the specific site. Therefore, investigations are desired to deliver antidiabetics using novel delivery approaches followed by their commercialization.The present review aims to provide a compilation on the latest development in the field of novel drug delivery systems (NDDSs) for antidiabetics with special emphasis on particulate, vesicular and miscellaneous systems.Review of literature (restricted to English language only) was done using electronic databases like Pubmed® and Scirus, i.e. published during 2005-2013. The CIMS/MIMS India Medical Drug Information eBook was used regarding available marketed formulation of antidiabetic drugs. Keywords used were "nanoparticle", "microparticle", "liposomes", "niosomes", "transdermal systems", "insulin", "antidiabetic drugs" and "novel drug delivery systems". Single inclusion was made for one article. If in vivo study was not done then article was seldom included in the manuscript.The curiosity to develop NDDSs of antidiabetic drugs with special attention to the nanoparticulate system followed by microparticulate and lipid-based system is found to emerge gradually to overcome the problems associated with the conventional dosage forms and to win the confidence of end users towards the higher acceptability.In the current scientific panorama when the area of novel drug delivery system has been recognized for its palpable benefits, unique potential of providing physical stability, sustained and site-specific drug delivery for a scheduled period of time can open new vistas for precise, safe and quality treatment of DM.

The formulation is intended for intranasal administration to treat glioma anticipating improved brain delivery as nasal route possess direct access to brain and nanoparticles have small size to overcome the mucosal and blood-brain barrier.Development and evaluation of carboplatin-PCL nanoparticles for brain delivery by nasal route.Carboplatin-loaded PCL nanoparticles (CPCs) were prepared by double emulsion-solvent evaporation technique and characterized by particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, scanning electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. The CPCs were assessed for in vitro release kinetics, ex vivo permeation and in situ nasal perfusion. Cytotoxic potential of CPCs in vitro was evaluated on LN229 human glioblastoma cells.The optimized formulation of carboplatin-PCL nanoparticle CPC-08 with particle size of 311.6\u2009±\u20094.7\u2009nm and zeta potential -16.3\u2009±\u20093.7\u2009mV exhibited percentage entrapment efficiency of 27.95\u2009±\u20094.21. In vitro drug release showed initial burst release followed by slow and continues release indicating biphasic pattern. The ex vivo permeation pattern through sheep nasal mucosa also exhibited a similar release pattern as for in vitro release studies. In situ nasal perfusion studies in Wistar rats demonstrate that CPCs show better nasal absorption than carboplatin solution. In vitro cytotoxicity studies on LN229 .cells showed an enhancement in cytotoxicity by CPCs compared to carboplatin alone.CPC-08 effectively improves nasal absorption of carboplatin and can be used for intranasal administration of carboplatin for improved brain delivery.

aVMethotrexate (MTX), an anticancer drug of choice, has poor permeability across blood-brain barrier (BBB) making it unsuitable for brain tumor application. Its brain availability and scope of application was improved by preparation of reversible conjugate with lysine by capitalizing the endogenous transport system of lysine at BBB.To enhance its delivery to brain, MTX was reversibly conjugated with l-Lysine by an amide linkage. It was characterized by advanced spectroscopy techniques including IR, NMR and MS. Furthermore, conjugate was assessed for stability, toxicity and drug release ability. In vivo distribution studies were done by radioscintigraphy study using (99m)Tc radioisotope.The structure of prodrug was confirmed by (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR and Mass. The m/e (mass to charge ratio) fragment was found at [M\u2009+\u2009H] 711.32 in Mass spectra. Stability and metabolic studies suggested that conjugate was stable at physiological pH (in Phosphate buffer pH 7.4 t1/2 is 70.25\u2009±\u20092.17\u2009h and in plasma t1/2 is 193.57\u2009±\u20092.03\u2009min) and circulated adequately to release MTX slowly in brain. In vivo biodistribution study showed that prodrug significantly increased the level of MTX in brain when compared with pharmacokinetic parameter of parent drug.The brain permeability of MTX was enhanced significantly by this conjugate.

aVNeck dissection leaves behind an aesthetically unacceptable scar over front of the neck. Various techniques, both endoscopic and robotic, have been tried to avoid this scar. Though comparatively more cases of robotic surgery are reported than endoscopic neck dissection, the cost and availability of robot precludes many patients from getting the benefit of minimally invasive neck dissection (MIND). We performed minimally invasive neck dissection for two carefully selected patients with early oral cancer and cN0. We used standard endoscopic equipment and ubiquitously available laparoscopic ports. We used gas insufflation to create the working space. Our results show that MIND is feasible and oncologically safe. The scars produced are aesthetically better than that of conventional open neck dissection. This procedure leaves no scars in the anterior aspect of the neck. This technique can be replicated at any center with endoscopic equipments without need for purchasing specialised retractors or a robot.

VSalvage Surgery for Cervical Cancer Recurrences.
p1517
aVCervical cancer usually presents in advanced stages and is treated with chemoradiation. About 15-20 % patients present with local recurrence after chemoradiation. Radical surgical resection is the only treatment modality offering long term survival benefit in recurrent cervical cancer. The most common surgical option for these patients is pelvic exenteration. Radical hysterectomy may be done for patients with a small centrally located recurrence in the cervix with no infiltration of adjacent structures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the morbidity and survival outcome following radical hysterectomy and pelvic exenteration for recurrent cancer cervix. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of our patients who underwent surgery for cancer cervix recurrence from January 2010 to December 2014. The postoperative morbidity was considered early if it happened in the initial 30 days of surgery and late if it occurred after 30 days. All patients were followed up till February 2015. Survival analysis was done using Kaplan- Meir method. Between January 2010 and December 2014, 20 patients with recurrent cervical cancer underwent radical surgical resection. The median age of the study group was 43 years (range 28-63 years). Seventeen patients had squamous cell carcinoma and 3 had adenocarcinoma. 13 underwent pelvic exenteration and 7 patients underwent radical type 2 hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphnode dissection. In the exenteration group, 8 patients had anterior exenteration, 4 had total exenteration and one had posterior exenteration. Urinary diversion was done by ileal conduit in 8 patients, double barrel colostomy in two and wet colostomy in two patients. There were no immediate postoperative deaths. Operating time, blood transfusions needed and hospital stay was more in the exenteration group compared to radical hysterectomy patients. After pelvic exenteration post-operative complications were seen in 76.9 % of which the most common was of the urinary tract including 3 patients with pyelonephritis, 5 had renal insufficiency and 2 patients developed urinary fistulae. Post-operative morbidity was lower in radical hysterectomy patients. There were two patients in the hysterectomy group who developed vault recurrence while none in the exenteration group had local recurrence. The median follow up time was 19 months (range 9-53 months).Three year overall survival for the entire cohort was 43 %. Median survival time for the exenteration group was 28 months which was significantly higher than 14 months for the radical hysterectomy group. This study shows that radical surgical resection is feasible with good survival outcome and acceptable morbidity in recurrent cancer cervix patients. Radical hysterectomy can be done in selected patients but pelvic exenteration has better long-term survival but with the potential for both short- & long-term complications.

VComparative study of fatty-acid composition of table eggs from the Jeddah food market and effect of value addition in omega-3 bio-fortified eggs.
p1520
aVHealth consciousness has increased the desire of people around the world to consume functional foods. Omega-3 essential fatty acids are one among these beneficial and important health supplements without which a general predisposition to degenerative and stress related disorders can occur. Saudi Arabia has shown an alarming increase in obesity (Al-Nozha et al., 2005), diabetes (Alqurashi et al., 2011), and cardiovascular disease (Al-Nozha et al., 2004) in the last few decades mainly due to nutritional transitions and lifestyle alterations (Amuna and Zotor, 2008). Lack of nutrient dense foods and the prevailing food related disorder of obesity (Popkin, 2001; Prentice, 2014) especially render egg as a choice food to be value-added for attaining nutritional security in Saudi Arabia and in effect reverse the increasing incidences of lifestyle diseases. Nutritional intervention through a commonly consumed food product would be an important step in improving the health of the people, and reducing health care costs. As eggs are a frequently consumed food item in Saudi Arabia, enriching them with omega-3 fatty acids would be an excellent way to alleviate the existing problems. A significant deposition of omega-3 fatty acids in the eggs was observed when the diet of hens was supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids from either flaxseed or fish oil source. Inadequacy of omega-3 fatty acids could thus be rectified by producing omega-3 enriched eggs from hens supplemented with flaxseed or fish oil source, and thus contribute toward better health choice of the consumer.

aVAlthough laparoscopic repair offers a quick and less morbid way of treating hernias, complications like hematoma, seroma, neuralgia, recurrence, mesh infection, hydrocele, etc. are known. The present study was undertaken to compare various clinical outcomes between mesh fixation using fibrin glue and mesh fixation with tacker in a 3-months follow-up. One hundred patients aged 18 to 60 years having inguinal hernia admitted in Poona Hospital and Research Centre, Pune, between October 2012 and November 2014 for laparoscopic hernia surgery and ready to participate in this study were included. All of them underwent laparoscopic repair of hernia by total extra peritoneal (TEP) method following sample surgical protocol in all of them except for method of mesh fixation. Mean time calculated from insertion of the first trocar to beginning of skin suturing was 54.9 min in tacker group and 50.3 min in fibrin glue group with no statistically significant difference between the two. The incidence of urinary retention was significantly higher in tacker (34 %) as compared to fibrin glue (12 %) group. Incidence of hematoma was significantly higher in tacker group in 15-day follow-up, but there was no significant difference in hematoma formation at hernial sites in both groups after 15 days of follow-up. The incidence of neuralgia was significantly higher in the tacker group (24 %) compared with the fibrin glue group (2 %). Significantly, more number of people in the fibrin glue group 68 and 90 %, respectively, returned to work during 15 and 30 days follow-up as compared to the tacker group 46 and 64 %. Fibrin glue can be considered as an alternative to tacker for mesh fixation.

aVAdenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is an unusual salivary gland malignancy that remains poorly understood. It is a slow growing but aggressive neoplasm with a tendency for recurrence. It is characterized by the proliferation of ductal (luminal) and myoepithelial cells in cribriform, tubular, solid, and cystic forms. Standard treatment, including surgery with postoperative radiation therapy, has attained reasonable local control rates, but distant metastases do not allow any improvement in the survival rate. The understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving ACC is quite rudimentary.

VMultiscale Opening of Conjoined Fuzzy Objects: Theory and Applications.
p1553
aVTheoretical properties of a multi-scale opening (MSO) algorithm for two conjoined fuzzy objects are established, and its extension to separating two conjoined fuzzy objects with different intensity properties is introduced. Also, its applications to artery/vein (A/V) separation in pulmonary CT imaging and carotid vessel segmentation in CT angiograms (CTAs) of patients with intracranial aneurysms are presented. The new algorithm accounts for distinct intensity properties of individual conjoined objects by combining fuzzy distance transform (FDT), a morphologic feature, with fuzzy connectivity, a topologic feature. The algorithm iteratively opens the two conjoined objects starting at large scales and progressing toward finer scales. Results of application of the method in separating arteries and veins in a physical cast phantom of a pig lung are presented. Accuracy of the algorithm is quantitatively evaluated in terms of sensitivity and specificity on patients' CTA data sets and its performance is compared with existing methods. Reproducibility of the algorithm is examined in terms of volumetric agreement between two users' carotid vessel segmentation results. Experimental results using this algorithm on patients' CTA data demonstrate a high average accuracy of 96.3% with 95.1% sensitivity and 97.5% specificity and a high reproducibility of 94.2% average agreement between segmentation results from two mutually independent users. Approximately, twenty-five to thirty-five user-specified seeds/separators are needed for each CTA data through a custom designed graphical interface requiring an average of thirty minutes to complete carotid vascular segmentation in a patient's CTA data set.

aVThe objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of dexamethasone given intra-massetrically via intra buccal approach on postoperative sequele after surgical extraction of impacted mandibular third molars.Twenty patients, each of who required surgical extraction of a single impacted mandibular third molar under local anesthesia, were randomly set apart to one of the two groups of ten each. The experimental group received dexamethasone 8 mg injected to the masseter muscle intra buccally and the control group did not receive any steroid. Facial swelling and maximal inter-incisal distance were measured by an independent examiner preoperatively, and at 4th h, on the day of surgery, 2 and 7 postoperative days. Pain was measured from the patient's response to a visual analogue scale.Patients were of the age range 18-40 years. Dexamethasone group showed significant reduction in swelling and pain compared with the control group at all intervals. Dexamethasone injected into the masseter muscle via intra buccal approach resulted in significantly less trismus than control on day one postoperatively.Dexamethasone 8 mg given intra-massetrically through intra buccal approach is an effective way of minimizing swelling, trismus, and pain following surgical extraction of impacted mandibular third molars. It offers a simple, safe, painless, non-invasive and cost-effective treatment.

aVIn patients with reconstructed mandibles using free fibula flaps, management of soft tissues around implants supporting dental rehabilitation, is often a clinical problem.The aim of this paper is to describe a new technique, namely "Sub-periosteal dissection and denture-guided epithelial regeneration (SD-DGER)", as a method of peri-implant soft tissue management in these patients.The technique consists of performing a subperiosteal dissection with creation of buccal and lingual flaps. These flaps form the buccal and lingual vestibule. Implants are placed and an interim denture is immediately loaded onto the implants to guide the regenerated epithelium. A keratinized mucosal layer is formed on the bare fibula bone in six months time.This technique was successful in producing fixed keratinized epithelial tissue around implants in patients with mandibles reconstructed using the free fibula flap in patients who did not undergo radiotherapy.The sub-periosteal dissection with denture guided epithelial regeneration is a predictable form of peri-implant soft tissue management in selected patients with reconstructed jaws.

aVInfertility treatment in couples where one or both parents are infected with hepatitis raises many concerns about transmission of the infection to the baby, laboratory technicians, and medical staff, and contamination of other gametes/embryos that are from virus-free parents in the same laboratory. Exposure to the other partner is only a risk when the couple's hepatitis status is discordant. The management of infertility, in association with HBV or HCV, has sparked debates about the potential risk of spread of infection to virus-free individuals, embryos, and/or semen. This risk can only be minimized or eliminated by the use of SOPs for safety in fertility clinics and by the use of proper initial detection and segregation of potentially hazardous materials. HBV may interfere with the development of embryos and even result in abortion and other adverse outcomes. Although sexual transmission of HCV is very low, in subfertile or infertile couples sperm washing should be used to treat HCV-positive semen before ART. Testing for HBsAg and HCV should be offered to high-risk infertile couples seeking fertility therapy to reduce the potential risk of transmission to an uninfected partner, baby, staff members, and disease-free gametes and embryos in the same laboratory. Testing for HIV, HBsAg, and HCV status should be performed on the couple prior to cryopreservation of semen or embryos.

VPresentation and Outcome of Castleman's Disease in Immunocompetent Hosts.

aVCastleman's disease (CD) is a heterogeneous lymphoproliferative disorder of unknown aetiology. Mostly, this disorder is seen in immunocompromised hosts. It is known to be associated with systemic disorders like HIV, HHV-8, lymphoma, and Kaposi sarcoma. As of today, the clinical behaviour and outcome of CD in immunocompetent host remains suboptimally studied. We analyzed consecutively treated cases of CD presented to our centre in last 12 years. Case record files were studied for patient's characteristics, clinical presentation, baseline laboratory and pathologic parameters, therapy and outcome. This study describes presentation and treatment outcome of CD in immunocompetent patients. Total 16 patients of CD were treated during the study period. The median age of patients at the time of presentation was 40.5 years (range 13-72 years). An equal number of patients (8 each) had unicentric and multicentric CD. Sixty-three percent patients had hyaline vascular subtype while 37 % patients had plasma cell or mixed variant. Majority of the patients had good performance status (ECOG PS 0, 1 in 10 (62.5 %) patients; PS2-4 in 6 (37.5 %) patients). The median duration of symptoms was 6 months (range 2-36 months). None of the patients in our study had associated HIV infection. Six patients presented with fever, out of which four had plasma cell variant of CD and three of them had multicentric involvement. In comparison to unicentric CD, patients with multicentric CD had lower albumin levels (4.15 vs. 3.38 g/dl, p = 0.006), haemoglobin levels (11.3 vs. 9.8, p = 0.06), and lower complete remission rates (62.5 % vs. none). Patients were treated according to the stage and clinical status with surgery, chemotherapy or combination of both modalities. Surgery was the predominant treatment for unicentric CD while multicentric CD was treated with various chemotherapy regimens. Eight patients were treated with chemotherapy (CHOP-based regimen-5, melphalan-prednisolone thalidomide-1, chlorambucil-prednisolone-1, and only corticosteroids-1). In the entire study group, ORR was 72 % (CR 36 %, PR 36 %), one patient died of progressive disease during chemotherapy. Two patients lost to follow-up before assessment of treatment response. Five-year overall survival was 100 and 87 % for unicentric and multicentric CD respectively. Castleman's disease is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder amongst Indian patients. It more commonly presents as hyaline vascular variant and affects middle-aged individuals. The most remarkable fact in our analysis was a lack of HIV positivity in any of the patient that is in contrast to the majority of the published literature. With multimodality therapy, high response rates and long-term survival were noted in the entire study group.

Long term survival in CML patients has provided an opportunity to better study natural history and long term complications of disease as well as the treatment modalities. To study the occurrence and association of other malignancies with their outcomes in patients with CML. This is a single centre retrospective study. All CML patients case records registered with haematology clinic of a tertiary care centre in North India from 2001 to 2014 were perused and evaluated for dual malignancies. Those patients with dual malignancies were personally examined and interviewed if alive. Out of 1677 patients, 15 cases had co-existent malignancies. Four of fifteen cases of dual malignancies had CML as secondary cancer. Three had synchronous and rest 12 patients had metachronous malignancies. Only one patient was in accelerated phase, rest all were in chronic phase. Median age of the dual malignancy cases was 50 years (25-66 years), much younger than reported in west. The initial dose of imatinib was 400 mg OD in all except one. We did not find any causal association between CML or imatinib therapy with development of secondary tumours. Interestingly in this series, incidence of CML as secondary or synchronous malignancy was higher than earlier published studies.

VA Systematic RNAi Screen of Neuroprotective Genes Identifies Novel Modulators of Alpha-Synuclein-Associated Effects in Transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans.
p1581
aVParkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder, defined clinically by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and the development of neuronal Lewy bodies. Current treatments of PD are inadequate due to a limited understanding of molecular events of the disease, thus calling for intense research efforts towards identification of novel therapeutic targets. We carried out the present studies towards identifying novel genetic modulators of PD-associated effects employing a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans model expressing human alpha-synuclein. Employing a systematic RNA interference (RNAi)-based screening approach, we studied a set of neuroprotective genes of C. elegans with an aim of identifying genes that exhibit protective function under alpha-synuclein expression conditions. Our results reveal a novel set of alpha-synuclein effector genes that modulate alpha-synuclein aggregation and associated effects. The identified genes include those from various gene families including histone demethylase, lactate dehydrogenase, small ribosomal subunit SA protein, cytoskeletal protein, collapsin response mediator protein, and choline kinase. The functional characterization of these genes reveals involvement of signaling mechanisms such as Daf-16 and acetylcholine signaling. Further elucidation of mechanistic pathways associated with these genes will yield additional insights into mediators of alpha-synuclein-induced cytotoxicity and cell death, thereby helping in the identification of potential therapeutic targets for PD.

VGreener approach for the extraction of copper metal from electronic waste.
p1585
aVTechnology innovations resulted into a major move from agricultural to industrial economy in last few decades. Consequently, generation of waste electronic and electrical equipments (WEEE) has been increased at a significant rate. WEEE contain large amount of precious and heavy metals and therefore, can be considered a potential secondary resource to overcome the scarcity of metals. Also, presence of these metals may affect the ecosystem due to lack of adequate management of WEEE. Building upon our previous experimental investigations for metal extraction from spent catalyst, present study explores the concept of green technology for WEEE management. Efforts have been made to recover base metal from a printed circuit board using eco-friendly chelation technology and results were compared with the conventional acid leaching method. 83.8% recovery of copper metal was achieved using chelation technology whereas only 27% could be recovered using acid leaching method in absence of any oxidant at optimum reaction conditions. Various characterization studies (energy dispersive X-ray analysis, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, inductive coupled plasma spectrophotometry) of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and residues were performed for qualitative and quantitative analysis of samples. Significant metal extraction, more than 96% recovery of chelating agent, recycling of reactant in next chelation cycle and nearly zero discharge to the environment are the major advantages of the proposed green process which articulate the transcendency of chelation technology over other conventional approaches. Kinetic investigation suggests diffusion controlled process as the rate determining step for the chelate assisted recovery of copper from WEEE with activation energy of 22kJ/mol.

VChlorpyrifos and Endosulfan degradation studies in an annular slurry photo reactor.
p1593
aVTiO2 is one of those compounds which are highly used in photocatalytic degradation of substrates using UV radiation. The substrates are degraded oxidatively and hence finds an important position in advanced oxidation for water/wastewater treatment processes. The thrust of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of Heterogeneous Photocatalysis (HP) technique, for the removal of pesticides from water/wastewater. The photo-catalytic degradation of two pesticides, widely used in India, viz., Endosulfan (ES) and Chlorpyriphos (CPS) was studied in an annular slurry photo reactor under UVillumination at 254nm. Results revealed that the degradation rate is significantly affected by the initial pesticide concentration, pH of the solution and catalyst concentration. Batch degradation studies on Endosulphan and Chlorpyrifos were conducted in the concentration range from 5 to 25mg/L at a pH ranging from 3.5 to 10.5 and at a catalyst loading of 0.5-2g/L. Endosulphan removal efficiency was about 80-99% and chlorpyrifos removal efficiency was about 84-94%. L-H rate constants were determined using L-H kinetics. High removal efficiencies obtained (80-99%) indicate the effectiveness of this process and its potential for practical application.

aVStringent Environmental standards followed worldwide led to the emergence of advanced oxidation process for the removal of toxic contaminants from water and wastewater. Among all semiconductor photocatalysts have great potential in the degradation of organic and inorganic pollutants into lesser harmful products under visible light irradiations. The present research work describes the synthesis of Cu doped ZnO (CuDZ) via a co-precipitation method to attain high crystallized powder confirmed by XRD analysis. The FE-SEM images showed that the CuDZ has cotton ball like morphology with a uniform size ranged from 25 to 40nm. TEM, FT-IR and UV-DRS studies of the synthesized CuDZ are also discussed in detail. The photocatalytic activity of the as prepared CuDZ catalyst was tested for the degradation of Direct Blue 71 (DB 71) dye in aqueous phase under visible light irradiation. The degree of degradation was found to be dependent on aqueous phase pH, duration of irradiation time, amount of photocatalyst, the initial dye concentration and kinetics of photodegradation. The maximum photocatytic degradation of DB 71 dye was found to be effective at pH 6.8. The optimum amount of photocatalyst was found 3gL(-1) of CuDZ for the complete degradation of DB 71 dye (0.01gL(-1)). The reusability of the photocatalyst indicates that 96% of DB 71 dye was degraded up to 3rd cycles of use. The visible photodegradation of DB 71 dye was exhibited pseudo-first-order kinetics. Chemical oxygen demand and ESI-MS studies confirmed the complete mineralization of DB 71 dye molecules.

In the present study heterogeneous sonocatalytic degradation of a model organic compound such as Malachite green oxalate (MGO) was carried out in the aqueous phase. Zinc oxide nanorods were prepared by precipitation method employing zinc acetates as precursors and were characterized by FT-IR, XRD, FE-SEM and EDAX analysis. Degradation of MGO in the aqueous phase was studied in detail under the sonocatalytic process. Effects of pH, dye concentration, oxidant concentration, kinetics and effect of electrolytes on dye degradation were carried out to check the efficiency of the sonocatalyst. Effect of energy input on the degradation processes was also investigated. The degradation of dye molecules were monitored by UV-visible spectrophotometer and Chemical Oxygen demand (COD). The dye molecules were readily degraded at above 90% in the pH range 5.0-7.0 under ultrasound with zinc oxide nanorods. The interference of electrolytes like NaCl, KCl, Na2CO3, NaHCO3 and MgSO4 on the degradation of dye molecules were also studied on the sonocatalytic degradation of MGO. From the kinetic studies it was observed that at lower initial concentration of dye molecules the degradation efficiency was above 90%. The rate of the reaction decreased on increasing the initial dye concentrations of the dye molecules. It was observed that the complete mineralization of dye molecules was achieved without the formation of toxic by-products. The reusability of the catalyst also showed the effective degradation of the dye molecules up to five cycles without loss of the catalytic activities.

VPerformance assessment of MCM-48 ceramic composite membrane by separation of AlCl3 from aqueous solution.
p1602
aVThree dimensional ordered mesoporous MCM-48 membrane was fabricated on a circular shaped ceramic support by in-situ hydrothermal method. The synthesized MCM-48 powder and MCM-48 ceramic composite membrane were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The porosity and pore size of the composite membrane are reduced considerably by the deposition of MCM-48 on the support. The formation of MCM-48 is verified by the XRD analysis. Three stepwise mechanisms for surfactant removal are observed by TGA analysis. FESEM images clearly signify the deposition of MCM-48 on the ceramic support. The pure water flux of the support and MCM-48 composite membrane is found to be 3.63×10(-6) and 4.18×10(-8)m(3)/m(2)skPa, respectively. The above prepared MCM-48 ceramic composite membrane is employed for the removal of AlCl3 from aqueous solution and the highest rejection of 81% is obtained at an applied pressure of 276kPa with salt concentration of 250ppm.

VEnergy production through organic fraction of municipal solid waste-A multiple regression modeling approach.
p1605
aVIn the 21st century, people migrated from rural to urban areas for several reasons. As a result, the populations of Indian cities are increasing day by day. On one hand, the country is developing in the field of science and technology and on the other hand, it is encountering a serious problem called 'Environmental degradation'. Due to increase in population, the generation of solid waste is also increased and is being disposed in open dumps and landfills which lead to air and land pollution. This study is attempted to generate energy out of organic solid waste by the bio- fermentation process. The study was conducted for a period of 7 months at Erode, Tamilnadu and the reading on various parameters like Hydraulic retention time, organic loading rate, sludge loading rate, influent pH, effluent pH, inlet volatile acids, out let volatile fatty acids, inlet VSS/TS ratio, outlet VSS/TS ratio, influent COD, effluent COD and % of COD removal are recorded for every 10 days. The aim of the present study is to develop a model through multiple linear regression analysis with COD as dependent variable and various parameters like HRT, OLR, SLR, influent, effluent, VSS/TS ratio, influent COD, effluent COD, etc as independent variables and to analyze the impact of these parameters on COD. The results of the model developed through step-wise regression method revealed that only four parameters Influent COD, effluent COD, VSS/TS and Influent/pH were main influencers of COD removal. The parameters influent COD and VSS/TS have positive impact on COD removal and the parameters effluent COD and Influent/pH have negative impact. The parameter Influent COD has the highest order of impact, followed by effluent COD, VSS/TS and influent pH. The other parameters HRT, OLR, SLR, INLET VFA and OUTLET VFA were not significantly contributing to the removal of COD. The implementation of the process suggested through this study might bring in dual benefit to the community, viz treatment of solid waste and creation of energy.

VIntegrated role of ROS and Ca(+2) in blue light-induced chloroplast avoidance movement in leaves of Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle.
p1608
aVDirectional chloroplast photorelocation is a major physio-biochemical mechanism that allows these organelles to realign themselves intracellularly in response to the intensity of the incident light as an adaptive response. Signaling processes involved in blue light (BL)-dependent chloroplast movements were investigated in Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle leaves. Treatments with antagonists of actin filaments [2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA)] and microtubules (oryzalin) revealed that actin filaments, but not microtubules, play a pivotal role in chloroplast movement. Involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in controlling chloroplast avoidance movement has been demonstrated, as exogenous H2O2 not only accelerated chloroplast avoidance but also could induce chloroplast avoidance even in weak blue light (WBL). Further support came from experiments with different ROS scavengers, i.e., dimethylthiourea (DMTU), KI, and CuCl2, which inhibited chloroplast avoidance, and from ROS localization using specific stains. Such avoidance was also partially inhibited by ZnCl2, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase (NOX) as well as 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), a photosynthetic electron transport chain (ETC) inhibitor at PS II. However, methyl viologen (MV), a PS I ETC inhibitor, rather accelerated avoidance response. Exogenous calcium (Ca(+2)) induced avoidance even in WBL while inhibited chloroplast accumulation partially. On the other hand, chloroplast movements (both accumulation and avoidance) were blocked by Ca(+2) antagonists, La(3+) (inhibitor of plasma membrane Ca(+2) channel) and ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA, Ca(+2) chelator) while LiCl that affects Ca(+2) release from endosomal compartments did not show any effect. A model on integrated role of ROS and Ca(+2) (influx from apolastic space) in actin-mediated chloroplast avoidance has been proposed.

VAlleviation of selenium toxicity in Brassica juncea L.: salicylic acid-mediated modulation in toxicity indicators, stress modulators, and sulfur-related gene transcripts.
p1611
aVThe present work reveals the response of different doses of selenium (Se) and alleviating effect of salicylic acid (SA) on Se-stressed Brassica juncea seedlings. Selenium, a micronutrient, is essential for both humans and animals but is toxic at higher doses. Its beneficial role for the survival of plants, however, is still debatable. On the other hand, SA, a phenolic compound, is known to have specific responses under environmental stresses. Experiments were conducted using leaves of hydroponically grown seedlings of Pusa bold (PB) variety of B. juncea, treated with different concentrations of Se (50, 150, 300 \u03bcM) for 24- and 96-h exposure times. Increasing Se concentrations inhibited growth and, caused lipid peroxidation, concomitantly increased stress modulators (proline, cysteine, SOD, CAT) along with sulfur-related gene transcripts (LAST, APS, APR, GR, OASL, MT-2, PCS) in Brassica seedlings. On the basis of the above studied parameters, maximum inhibition in growth was observed at 300 \u03bcM Se after 96-h exposure time. Further, co-application of SA along with 300 \u03bcM Se helped to mitigate Se stress, as shown by improved levels of growth parameters, toxicity indicators (chlorophyll, protein, MDA), stress modulators (proline, cysteine, SOD, and CAT), and expression of sulfur-related genes as compared to Se-treated seedlings alone. Altogether, this study revealed that Se\u2009+\u2009SA combinations improved seedling morphology and were effective in alleviation of Se stress in PB variety of B. juncea.

VDevelopment and clinical study of submicronic-atropine sulphate respiratory fluid as a novel organophosphorous poisoning antidote.
p1618
aVIncreased use of organophosphate insecticides (OPI) and possibility of terror groups using stocks of nerve agents underscore the need to develop effective and safe antidotes. While intramuscular administration of antidotes like atropine sulphate (AS) has certain lacunae, intravenous route may not be always feasible in emergency field conditions.Objective was (a) to develop a novel inhalable submicronic-AS respiratory fluid as potential antidote for OPI poisoning, (b) in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation in terms of respiratory fraction, and (c) clinical study to assess drug bioavailability in blood and atropinization pattern post-inhalation.Formulation was optimized on the basis of particle size of aerosolized droplets and in-vitro nebulization rate. Anderson cascade impaction (ACI) studies were carried out to validate the advantage of test formulation in terms of respirable fraction. Six healthy volunteers were inhaled the test formulation and blood bioavailability and atropinization were noted serially. Gamma scintigraphy was used to quantify total and regional lung deposition of nebulized AS in-vivo.The formulation was optimized using 30% ethanol-saline with particle size in the range of 350-500\u2009nm. In-vitro ACI data showed high respirable fraction (82.6\u2009±\u20093.1%) for the test formulation. In-vivo scintigraphy suggested whole lung deposition of 80.2\u2009±\u20096.8% of the total inhaled dose. Early blood bioavailability and atropinization pattern confirmed that therapeutic concentration of the drug in blood was reached within 5\u2009min.3% submicronic-AS respiratory fluid might be used as potential prophylactic/therapeutic option against OPI poisoning with several advantages over intramuscular injection, including early blood bioavailability and atropinization.

aVThe aim of the novel study was to check the efficacy of a locally applied 2%w/w nanoemulgel (NEG) of Ketoprofen (KP) in preventing the periodontitis, and was also checked NEG without KP to ensure the effect of eugenol in NEG as an oil phase.For experimentally induced periodontitis, sterile silk ligatures (3/0) were placed around the crevices of the first left lower molar teeth of the male Wistar rats. During 8 weeks, all rats were fed with 10%w/v sucrose solution. The experimental assessment was carried out at 11 d after treatment of experimental periodontal disease (EPD) rats by various clinical parameters like gingival index (GI), tooth mobility (TM), alveolar bone loss (ABL), histological analysis, detection of TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 in gingival tissue by ELISA and the roughness were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping modes.After treatment, comparison studies with EPD were performed. NEG loaded with KP prevents significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) various parameters (GI, TM, and ABL), which were responsible for periodontitis. The histopathology of the periodontium showed that Group 3 (NEG loaded with KP) had a more significant reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration, alveolar bones resorption, and cementum (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In the topographical images, significant reduction in roughness of NEG loaded with KP was observed in comparison with EPD without treatment.The study revealed the great synergistic potential of the combined NEG of an anti-inflammatory drug KP along with eugenol as the oil phase, which have potential antibacterial, analgesic, and anesthetic properties to combat periodontal disease.

aVStroke is a one of the leading causes of disease and deaths worldwide, which causes irreversible deterioration of the central nervous system. Curcuminoids are reported to have a potential role in the amelioration of cerebral ischemia but they exhibit low serum and tissue levels due to low solubility and poor absorption. Curcumin (CUR), demethoxycurcumin (DMC) and bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC)-loaded PNIPAM nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by free radical polymerization and characterized for particles size, entrapment efficiency, zeta potential, in vitro release and ex vivo permeation study. Optimized CUR, DMC and BDMC-loaded NPs had the mean size of 92.46\u2009±\u20092.8, 91.23\u2009±\u20094.2 and 94.28\u2009±\u20091.91\u2009nm; zeta potential of -16.2\u2009±\u20091.42, -15.6\u2009±\u20091.33 and -16.6\u2009±\u20091.21 mV; loading capacity of 39.31\u2009±\u20093.7, 38.91\u2009±\u20093.6 and 40.61\u2009±\u20093.6% and entrapment efficiency of 84.63\u2009±\u20094.2, 84.71\u2009±\u20093.99 and 85.73\u2009±\u20094.31%, respectively. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectroscopy based bioanalytical method was developed and validated for pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, brain-targeting efficiency and brain drug-targeting potential studies post-intranasal (i.n.) administration which showed enhanced bioavailability of curcuminoids in brain as compared to intravenous administration. Improved neurobehavioural activity (locomotor and grip strength) and reduced cytokines levels (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2) was observed in middle cerebral artery occlusion induced cerebral ischemic rats after i.n. administration of curcuminoids NPs. Finally, the toxicity study was performed which revealed safe nature of developed NPs.

p1634
aVA large number of medicinal plants are used as herbal remedy for the treatment of helminthic diseases in the developing countries, however, far too little attention has been paid to assess the anthelmintic potentials of chemical compounds that are present in these plants. This study was carried out to assess the in vitro anthelmintic effects of biochanin A, ursolic acid, betulinic acid and beta-sitosterol which are the major phytochemicals of Trifolium repens, Houttuynia cordata and Lasia spinosa, the traditionally used anthelmintic plants of Northeast India. The in vitro anthelmintic testing of these phytochemicals was undertaken against Hymenolepis diminuta, a zoonotic tapeworm, and their efficacy was compared with a reference drug, praziquantel. The results revealed that except beta-sitosterol, which showed a very weak anthelmintic effect, remaining all other tested compounds possess highly significant (p \u2264 0.001) and dose-dependent anthelmintic effects. Upon exposure to 0.25, 0.50 and 1 mg/ml concentrations of biochanin A, ursolic acid and betulinic acid, the test parasite H. diminuta, at first, showed a paralyzed state which later culminated into their mortality after short time periods. Of all the phytochemicals tested, betulinic acid (1 mg/ml) showed the best anthelmintic effect and caused the mortality of test parasites at 3.4 ± 0.66 h. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate for the first time that betulinic acid, biochanin A and ursolic acid possess significant in vitro anthelmintic effects against H. diminuta, a zoonotic tapeworm, and, therefore, these compounds may be exploited further for anthelmintic drug development.

VPathobiology of human RH strain induced experimental toxoplasmosis in murine model.
p1637
aVOf late, toxoplasmosis has gained immense importance as an opportunist parasite in immunocompromised patients. In immunocompromised subjects, the disease is supposed to occur in acute form and causes acute toxoplasmic encephalitis. However, the exact pathogenesis of other vital organs, particularly in acute form of infection, is still a matter of debate. Therefore, an attempt was made to study the pathogenesis of acute form of toxoplasmosis using cryopreserved human RH strain of the parasite in murine models. For this, 100 tachyzoites were given to individual mice and upon the setup of acute form of infection, the mice were euthanized and the organs were processed for histopathology. Histopathology revealed tachyzoites in liver only while severe necrosis due to multiplication of tachyzoites were visible in liver, spleen, lungs and brain. Kidneys and heart appeared more or less normal. Finally, the pathology of disease in these organs is described in detail. The present research has generated some vital information regarding necrotic changes in tissues due to acute toxoplasmosis and will defiantly help the researchers in the better understanding of disease particularly in humans and putting up of suitable treatment regime for human subjects infected with acute toxoplasmosis.

aVCryptosporidium parvum is an important zoonotic protozoan parasite that infects the gastrointestinal tract of vertebrate animals and man. The current study was contemplated for molecular detection of Cryptosporidium species prevalent in dairy calves in Punjab, India. A total of 302 faecal samples were screened by modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique for the detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts. Molecular characterisation was done using PCR followed by sequence analysis of the representative isolates. An overall prevalence of 26.15 % was obtained with the highest prevalence obtained in 0-30 day old calves in both diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic animals. PCR analysis revealed the expected bands at 1,325 and 835 bp from all the isolates for primary and secondary/nested PCR respectively. Ten representative samples were sequenced in both directions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of C. parvum in all the samples. The high rate of calves infected with C. parvum can act as a great source of zoonotic cryptosporidiosis which indicates a potential risk of zoonotic transmission from animal to human beings in Punjab (India).

The colonies showing different morphologies were streaked on selective agar plates. The antibacterial assay of selected commercial antibiotics was tested against the foot ulcer and urinary tract isolates. The result revealed that most of the organisms were found to be resistant against the antibiotics. Screening of antibacterial activity of selected plants, methanol extracts of plants were prepared and tested against foot ulcer pathogens. Among the plants used, the methanolic extract Tragia involucrata was very effective against the foot ulcer pathogens and to separate the compounds present in the methanolic extract of T. involucrata, when it was subjected to column chromatography. The fractions obtained were further checked for their antibacterial property and fraction 1 which inhibited the pathogens, were subjected to thin layer chromatography and the structure of the particular phytochemical compound was elucidated by NMR study. The spices were tested for their antibacterial property against the urinary tract pathogens. Among the spices tested; Allium sativum inhibited the growth of the pathogens isolated from urinary tract infection. It can be concluded that the plants extract can be used to discover natural products that may serve as lead for the development of new pharmaceuticals addressing the major therapeutic needs.

The observations encouraged us to check the prophylactic efficacy of subcutaneous (s.c.) route as it is better alternative for human trial. The mice immunized with two subsequent doses of the radio attenuated homologous vaccine were challenged with virulent L. donovani parasites. Seventy-five days post infection, the animals were sacrificed. The extent of protection against the disease was evaluated by assessing the reduction of parasite burden in spleen and liver, the generation of free radicals (NO & ROS) and release of the cytokines from T-lymphocyte helper 1 (Th 1) and T-lymphocyte helper 2 (Th 2) along with the measurement of the serum immunoglobulins. The reductions in parasitic burden were observed up to 21 and 24 % in spleen and liver of the immunized groups with NO and ROS productions 27 and 34 % respectively. Whereas the increase in IFN gamma releases was between 19 and 34 %, the decrease in IL-10 release was not more than 22 %. This indicates the failure of the establishment of pronounced Th1 ambience which was further corroborated by the observed IgG2a and IgG1 ratio. The present study when compared with our previous observations with i.m. and i.p. routes revealed that s.c. route may not be a good choice for the use of radio attenuated vaccine.

p1659
aVUlcerative colitis is the chronic relapsing multifactorial gastrointestinal inflammatory bowel disease, which is characterized by bloody or mucus diarrhea, tenesmus, bowel dystension, anemia. The annual incidence of ulcerative colitis in Asia, North America and Europe was found to be 6.3, 19.2 and 24.3 per 100,000 person-years. The major challenge in the treatment of ulcerative colitis is appropriate local targeting and drug related side-effects. To overcome these challenges, microparticulate systems seem to be a promising approach for controlled and sustained drug release after oral administration. The main goal of this article is to explore the role of microparticles in ulcerative colitis for the appropriate targeting of drugs to colon. There are different approaches which have been studied over the last decade, including prodrugs, polymeric approach, time released system, pH sensitive system, which show the site specific drug delivery to colon. Among these approaches, microparticulate drug delivery system has been gaining an immense importance for local targeting of drug to colon at a controlled and sustained rate. Combined approaches such as pH dependent and time dependent system provide the maximum release of drug into colon via oral route. This article embraces briefly about pathophysiology, challenges and polymeric approaches mainly multiparticulate systems for site specific drug delivery to colon in sustained and controlled manner so that drug related side-effects by reducing dosage frequency can be minimized.

We also wished to judge their relationship with other parameters like clinical staging and histopathologic tumor type.The present study was conducted on 86 patients during the study period of 2.5 years. Preoperative CA 125 levels were evaluated by an automated immunoassay analyzer. p53 expression was judged immunohistochemically with pre-diluted monoclonal antibody. An objective scoring was done depending on distinct nuclear immunopositivity.Median value of preoperative CA 125 levels was 32 U/mL in benign surface epithelial-stromal tumors (BSEST), 53 U/mL in borderline surface epithelial-stromal tumors (BOT), 346 U/mL in malignant surface epithelial-stromal tumors (MSEST) and 560 U/mL in serous adenocarcinomas (SAC). Most of ovarian tumors were in the FIGO stage I (64 cases, 74.4%), but higher stages (II, III, IV) were observed mostly in MSESTs. SACs displayed the maximum p53 expression. Considering the cut-off value of more than 35 U/mL in CA 125 levels, the sensitivity to diagnose MSESTs was 94.7%. Preoperative CA 125 levels strongly and positively correlated with FIGO staging and p53 expression. Similarly p53 expression strongly and positively correlated with FIGO staging and histopathological categories.Higher values of preoperative CA 125 levels and higher expression p53 are associated with MSESTs and BOTs especially of serous type. They strongly correlate with each other and with tumor stage. But there is no serum CA 125 concentration that can clearly differentiate benign and malignant ovarian masses.

VSurgical Management of Benign Coloesophageal Stricture: a Novel Technique.
p1668
aVBenign coloesophageal anastomotic stricture in postoperative colon bypass patients suffering from the corrosive stricture of the upper esophagus is a challenging problem. Failure of repeated endoscopic balloon dilatation makes way for revisional operative techniques like free jejunal grafts or interposition skin tube based on radial vessels. The situation arising from the morbidity of such reconstructive procedures, at times, becomes more complex than the stricture itself [1]. This clinical scenario has compelled us to innovate with a much simpler technique using buccal mucosal graft (BMG) to manage these strictures. Currently, the utility of BMG is mostly limited to urethral reconstruction. Overtime, it has become an ideal urethral substitute. Here, we present a case series of five patients who have been subjected to coloesophagoplasty with BMG and have demonstrated excellent results. With a median follow-up of 13 months, all patients have fully recovered and are taking solid and liquid foods satisfactorily. Thus, the option of coloesophagoplasty with BMG should always be kept in consideration while planning a revision surgery for a small-segment benign coloesophageal anastomotic stricture in the corrosive injury of the esophagus, considering the ease and excellent outcome.

VHigh Ligation of Inferior Mesenteric Artery in Left Colonic and Rectal Cancers: Lymph Node Yield and Survival Benefit.
p1681
aVDuring surgery for colorectal cancer, the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) may be ligated either directly at the origin of the IMA from the aorta (high ligation) or at a point just below the origin of the left colic artery (low ligation). Sixty patients of left colonic and rectal cancer undergoing elective curative surgery in 2007 and 2008 were selected for this observational study. The resected lymph nodes were grouped into three levels: along the bowel wall (D1), along IMA below left colic (D2), and along the IMA and its root (D3). Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 20.0. D2 level was involved pathologically in 20 (33.3 %) and D3 in six out of 44 (13.6 %) patients. The median nodal yield with high and low ligation were 33 and 25, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.048). Median overall survival for high ligation was 62 months versus 42 months for low ligation (p\u2009=\u20090.190). High ligation of the IMA for rectal and left colonic cancers can improve lymph node yield, thus facilitating accurate tumor staging and thus better disease prognostication, but the survival benefit is not significant.

VEvaluation of Pain Preoperatively and Postoperatively in Patients with Chronic Pancreatitis Undergoing Longitudinal Pancreaticojejunostomy.
p1684
aVChronic pancreatitis is a fairly common condition with pain being the major symptom, and longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy (LPJ) is performed for symptomatic relief. The aim of the study is to assess relief of pain post-LPJ for chronic pancreatitis and to evaluate the factors influencing relief of symptoms. A prospective observational non-interventional study enrolling 28 patients. This study involved a questionnaire studying various risk factors and pain related to chronic pancreatitis, pancreaticojejunostomy, and postoperative assessment of pain relief at 1 and 6 months from surgery. Pain was assessed using Visual analogue scale (VAS). In chronic pancreatitis, there is a significant relief in symptoms of pain post-LPJ; the degree of relief was less in the alcoholics vs non-alcoholics (p\u2009=\u20090.09) and smokers. There was also reduction in analgesic requirement and frequency of acute attacks of pain. Fifty-seven percent of patients had a complete remission of their pain after LPJ for CP. In chronic pancreatitis, there is a significant relief in symptoms of pain post-LPJ, although the degree of relief is less in the alcoholics and smokers.

aVPaget's disease of the breast is uncommon and patients may present with nipple discharge, eczema, plaque or nipple destruction with or without a lump. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presentation, clinicopathological features and treatment given for patients presenting with Paget's disease of the breast. We performed a retrospective analysis of medical records of patients who were treated at our centre for Paget's disease of the breast from 2006-2011. Twenty patients were treated in this period. Twelve patients had associated lump and eight patients did not have a lump in the breast. Two patients did not have a lump or any detected abnormality in mammography. Multicentricity was present in five patients. Diagnosis of malignancy was made by fine-needle aspiration cytology for patients with palpable lump and nipple wedge biopsy for patients with no lump. Modified radical mastectomy was done in 10 patients: 2 patients underwent total mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy and 8 patients underwent central quadrantectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Eleven patients had invasive ductal carcinoma, one patient had ductal carcinoma in situ with foci of invasion and eight patients had ductal carcinoma in situ. Seven patients had lymph node metastases. Three patients had recurrence, one had local recurrence and two had distant recurrences. The mean follow up period was 28 months (range 15-64 months). Paget's disease of the breast is a rare entity and one needs imaging and biopsy to diagnose these patients as they have associated cancer. They can be considered for breast conservation surgery with good cosmetic and oncological results.

VThe Relationship Between Body Mass Index and Bone Mineral Density in Premenopausal and Postmenopausal North Indian Women.
p1690
aVPresent study aims to examine the relationship of the bone mineral density (BMD) with body mass index (BMI) in an apparently healthy premenopausal and postmenopausal north Indian female population.Two hundred and fifty-five apparently healthy women were evaluated by a detailed questionnaire including all possible factors that could affect the BMD. The height and weight of all the subjects were recorded and BMI was calculated. Bone mineral density was measured by DXA (Dual Electron X-ray Absorptiometry) at L1-L4 Lumbar spine (LS) and femur neck (FN) by using the Prodigy DXA system (software version:8.50) manufactured by GE medical systems LUNAR.The population was divided into pre and postmenopausal groups. The BMD at all sites increased with BMI in both groups. In a multiple regression model, the attributability of BMI and age to variation in LSBMD and FNBMD was 10.3 and 13.9 %, respectively. In postmenopausal women, age, BMI, and a previous history of fracture together attributed to a variance in BMI of 40.1 and 27.6 % at lumbar spine and femur neck, respectively. BMI was found to be significantly associated with low BMD at both sites in premenopausal women, while the association was lost in postmenopausal females.BMI is an important determinant of BMD in Indian females. However, the association is not present in postmenopausal women with osteopenia. In addition, the effect of increase in BMI on BMD has a ceiling effect, and moderate to morbid obesity might not actually be a preventive factor for osteopenia.

VDetermination of mesiodistal width of maxillary anterior teeth using inner canthal distance.
p1696
aVSelection of appropriately sized maxillary anterior teeth is one of the important aspects of complete denture prosthodontics. In the past several methods have been proposed, but little consensus on an effective method for anterior teeth selection has been reached. Inner canthal distance is one of the reliable anatomic dimension that may provide a valid approach to anterior teeth selection. This study was aimed to ascertain the co-relation between inner canthal distance (ICD) and combined mesiodistal width of maxillary anterior teeth.This study was conducted in Army Dental Centre (R & R) Delhi Cantonment between Aug 2006 to Mar 2008. Eight hundred dentate Indian subjects of four different ethnic group; Such as Rajputs, Marathas, Sikh and Tamilian. 100 males and 100 females from each race under the age group of 18-30 years formed the subjects of study. The ICD and mesio-distal width of maxillary anteriors were measured using Digital Vernier Caliper. The Data obtained was statistically analyzed.A consistent ratio of 1.61 was found between ICD and combined mesiodistal width of maxillary anteriors in all four ethnic group. The mean value showed no statistically significant difference between sex. The variation in the ratio between the ethnic groups was negligible.The findings of the study indicated that, to select the combined mesiodistal width of maxillary anterior teeth, ICD of the required patient should be multiplied by 1.61. This ratio was consistent with all the four ethnic groups irrespective of sex.

p1699
aVSleep disorders are a group of disorders characterized by abnormalities of respiration during sleep. OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea) is characterized by the repetitive episodes of complete or partial collapse of the upper airway during sleep, causing a cessation or a significant reduction of airflow.The study population consisted of 30 control patients (AHI \u2264 5) events per hour, 74 patients with OSAS, including 34 Obese (BMI \u2265 27) and 40 non-obese (BMI \u2264 27). Polysomnography and measurements of 21 cephalometric variables were carried out for all patients with OSAS.Obese patient with OSAS showed significant difference in following cephalometric parameters: (1) PAS (2) MPT (3) MPH (4) PNS-P (5) SAS. In addition, obese patient had longer tongue (TGL), more anteriorly displaced hyoid bones (H-VL) and more anterior displacement of mandible (G-VL) when compared with control groups. The findings of non-obese patients when compared to controls showed all the findings of obese patients and in addition to that narrow bony oropharynx were significant. Step wise regression analysis showed the significant predictors for all patients were MPH, PNS-P, bony nasopharynx (PNSBa), MPT, and palatal length (ANS-PNS) for AHI. The significant predictors for obese OSA (obstructive sleep apnea) group were MAS while for non-obese OSA group ANS-PNS was significant predictor for AHI (apnea-hypopnea index).Craniofacial landmarks such as increase in hyoid distance, longer tongue and soft palate with increased thickness and narrowing of superior pharyngeal, oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal airway space may be important risk factors for development of OSAS.

VEnhancing Skin Permeation of Biphenylacetic Acid (BPA) Using Salt Formation with Organic and Alkali Metal Bases.
p1703
aVIn the present study, a series of organic and alkali metal salts of biphenylacetic acid (BPA) have been prepared and evaluated in vitro for percutaneous drug delivery. The physicochemical properties of BPA salts were determined using solubility measurements, DSC, and IR. The DSC thermogram and FTIR spectra confirmed the salt formation with organic and alkali metal bases. Among the series, salts with organic amines (ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, and diethylamine) had lowered melting points while the alkali metal salt (sodium) had a higher melting point than BPA. The in vitro study showed that salt formation improves the physicochemical properties of BPA, leading to improved permeability through the skin. Amongst all the prepared salts, ethanolamine salt (1b) showed 7.2- and 5.4-fold higher skin permeation than the parent drug at pH 7.4 and 5.0, respectively, using rat skin.

aVA short and sensitive stability-indicating gradient RP-UPLC method was developed for the quantitative determination of process-related impurities and degradation products of tolterodine tartrate in pharmaceutical formulations. The method was developed by using the Waters ACQUITY UPLC\u2122 BEH shield RP18 (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm) column with a mobile phase containing a gradient mixture of solvent A and B at a detection wavelength of 210 nm. During the stress study, the degradation products of tolterodine tartrate were well-resolved from tolterodine and its impurities and the mass balances were found to be satisfactory in all the stress conditions, thus proving the stability-indicating capability of the method. The developed method was validated as per ICH guidelines with respect to specificity, linearity, limit of detection and quantification, accuracy, precision, ruggedness, and robustness. During the stability (40°C/75% RH, 3 months) analysis of the drug product, one unknown impurity was detected by the above stability-indicating method. The unknown impurity was isolated by preparative HPLC and subjected to mass and NMR studies. Based on the spectral data, the unknown impurity was characterised as 2-(3-amino-1-phenylpropyl)-4-methylphenol (des-N,N-diisopropyl tolterodine). Structural elucidation of the impurity by spectral data is discussed in detail.

VComputational approach to understanding the mechanism of action of isoniazid, an anti-TB drug.
p1723
aVTuberculosis (TB) is an ancient disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), which remains a major cause for morbidity and mortality in several developing countries. Most drug-resistant MTB clinical strains are resistant to isoniazid (INH), a first-line anti-TB drug. Mutation in KatG, a catalase-peroxidase, of MTB is reported to be a major cause of INH resistance. Normally upon activation by KatG, INH is converted to an active intermediate which has antimycobacterial action in MTB. This INH intermediate in the presence of NADH forms INH-NAD adduct which inhibits inhA (2-trans-enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase) of MTB, thus blocking the synthesis of mycolic acid, a major lipid of the mycobacterial cell wall. In this docking study, the high binding affinity of INH-NAD adduct towards InhA was observed in comparison with INH alone. In this study, two resistant mutants of KatG (S315T and S315N) were modeled using Modeller9v10 and docking analysis with INH was performed using AutoDock4.2 and the docking results of these mutants were compared with the wild type KatG. Docking results revealed the formation of a single hydrogen (H) bond between the secondary amine nitrogen (-NH) of INH with Thr or Asn residues in place of Serine at 315 position of KatG mutant strains respectively, whereas in the case of the wild type, there was no H-bond formation observed between INH and Ser315. The H-bond formation may prevent free radical formation by KatG in mutant strains thus the development of resistance to the drug. This in silico evidence may implicate the basis of INH resistance in KatG mutant strains.

VOptimization and validation of Mycobacterium marinum-induced adult zebrafish model for evaluation of oral anti-tuberculosis drugs.
p1726
aVMycobacterium marinum has emerged as a suitable species for induction of tuberculosis-like disease in zebrafish, and various zebrafish models (larval and adult) for drug screening have been proposed in the literature. It is believed that an adult zebrafish model is more useful in drug screening because, apart from assessment of efficacy, one can obtain data on dosage, pharmacokinetics and overall health improvement. This study suggests a simple, cost-effective and resource-efficient protocol for screening of anti-tuberculosis drugs.The parameters used for assessment of infection as well as anti-bacterial response were: (a) bacterial count; and (b) body weight change. An optimization study was conducted to establish the concentration of bacteria required to produce a reproducible phenotype of tuberculosis (TB). A negative control (Amoxicillin) and anti-mycobacterial drugs (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Moxifloxacin, Ethambutol and Isoniazid+Rifampicin) were used for validation of the protocol. All the drugs were administered orally.An intra-peritoneal inoculation of 0.75million bacteria/fish was optimized for the model. All the anti-tuberculosis drugs showed efficacy in this model, whereas the negative control did not show any signs of reversing the parameters of M. marinum infection.Adult zebrafish model of M. marinum-induced tuberculosis has not been fully exploited as a drug screening tool. In the present report, a protocol is suggested that is simple, reproducible and resource-efficient for screening of anti-tuberculosis agents. This protocol is an attempt to refine the published protocols and use this model as a surrogate model of human TB for the purpose of drug screening.

VSafety of the two-step tuberculin skin test in Indian health care workers.
p1729
aVHealth care workers (HCW) in low and middle income countries are at high risk of nosocomial tuberculosis infection. Periodic screening of health workers for both TB disease and infection can play a critical role in TB infection control. Occupational health programs that implement serial tuberculin skin testing (TST) are advised to use a two-step baseline TST. This helps to ensure that boosting of waned immune response is not mistaken as new TB infection (i.e. conversion). However, there are no data on safety of the two-step TST in the Indian context where HCWs are repeatedly exposed.Nursing students were recruited from 2007 to 2009 at the Christian Medical College and Hospital, Vellore, India. Consenting nursing students were screened with a baseline two-step TST at the time of recruitment. From 2007 to 2008 adverse events were recorded when reported during the TST reading (Cohort A). Nurses recruited in the final study year (2009) answered an investigator administered questionnaire assessing all likely side-effects Cohort B). This information was extracted from the case report forms and analysed.Between 2007 and 09, 800 trainees consented to participate in the annual TB screening study and 779 did not have a past history of TB or recall a positive TST and were selected to administer TST. Of these, 755 returned for reading the result and had complete data and were included for the final analysis - 623 subjects in (cohort A) and 132 in (cohort B). These were included for the final analysis. In cohort A only 1.3% reported adverse events. In cohort B, as per the investigator administered questionnaire; 25% reported minor side effects. Itching and local pain were the most common side effects encountered. There were no major adverse events reported. In particular, the adverse events were similar in the second step of the test and not more severe.Screening of HCWs with two-step TST for LTBI is simple and safe, and hence suitable for wide scale implementation in high-burden settings such as India.

p1732
aVSevoflurane is an inhalational agent of choice in paediatric anaesthesia. For management of airways in children a suitable alternative to ETT is a paediatric proseal laryngeal mask airway (benchmark second generation SAD). Various studies have shown that less sevoflurane concentration is required for LMA insertion in comparison to TI. BIS is a useful monitor of depth of anaesthesia.To compare concentration of sevoflurane (end tidal and MAC value) required for proseal laryngeal mask airway insertion and tracheal intubation in correlation with BIS index.The prospective randomised single blind study was done in children between 2 and 9 years of ASA I and II and they were randomly allocated to Group P (proseal laryngeal mask airway insertion) and Group TI (tracheal intubation). No sedative premedication was given. Induction was done with 8% sevoflurane and then predetermined concentration was maintained for 10 min. Airway was secured either by proseal laryngeal mask airway or endotracheal tube without using muscle relaxant. End tidal sevoflurane concentration, MAC, BIS, and other vital parameters were monitored every minute till insertion of an airway device. Insertion conditions were observed. Statistical analysis was done by ANOVA and Students t test.Difference between ETLMI (2.49 ± 0.44) and ETTI (2.81 ± 0.65) as well as MACLMI (1.67 ± 0.13) and MACTI (1.77 ± 0.43) was statistically very significant, while BISLMI (49.05 ± 10.76) and BISTI (41.25 ± 3.25) was significant. Insertion conditions were comparable in both the groups.We can conclude that in children airway can be secured safely with proseal laryngeal mask airway using less sevoflurane concentration in comparison to tracheal intubation and this was supported by BIS index.

Study group (n=45) - Airtraq laryngoscope was used for laryngoscopy. Control group (n=45) - conventional Macintosh laryngoscope was used for laryngoscopy. Preoperative baseline intraocular pressure was measured with Schiotz tonometer. Laryngoscopy was done as per group protocol. Intraocular pressure and haemodynamic parameters were recorded just before insertion of the device and subsequently three times at an interval of one minute after insertion of the device.Patient characteristics, baseline haemodynamic parameters and baseline intraocular pressure were comparable in the two groups. Following insertion of the endotracheal tube with Macintosh laryngoscope, there was statistically significant rise in heart rate and intraocular pressure compared to Airtraq group. There was no significant change in MAP. Eight patients in Macintosh group had tongue-lip-dental trauma during intubation, while only 2 patients received upper airway trauma in Airtraq group.We conclude that Airtraq laryngoscope in comparison to Macintosh laryngoscope results in significantly fewer rises in intraocular pressure and clinically less marked increase in haemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation.

p1750
aVA new measure for quantifying diagnostic information from a multilead electrocardiogram (MECG) is proposed. This diagnostic measure is based on principal component (PC) multivariate multiscale sample entropy (PMMSE). The PC analysis is used to reduce the dimension of the MECG data matrix. The multivariate multiscale sample entropy is evaluated over the PC matrix. The PMMSE values along each scale are used as a diagnostic feature vector. The performance of the proposed measure is evaluated using a least square support vector machine classifier for detection and classification of normal (healthy control) and different cardiovascular diseases such as cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysrhythmia, hypertrophy and myocardial infarction. The results show that the cardiac diseases are successfully detected and classified with an average accuracy of 90.34%. Comparison with some of the recently published methods shows improved performance of the proposed measure of cardiac disease classification.

aVOsteoma is a slow growing benign tumor consisting of well differentiated compact or cancellous bone that increases in size by continuous growth. It can be of a central, peripheral, or extraskeletal type. The peripheral type arises from the periosteum and is rarely seen in mandible. Although completely curable with adequate surgical treatment, osteomas precede the clinical radiographic evidence of colonic polyposis/Gardner's syndrome. Therefore they may be sensitive markers for the disease. Recurrence of peripheral osteoma after surgical excision is extremely rare. However it is appropriate to provide both clinical and radiographic follow up after surgical excision of peripheral osteoma. This article describes the case of a 45 year old male who presented with painless swelling of the right body of mandible and resultant cosmetic facial disfigurement and functional impairment.

VBasal Cell Adenoma of Submandibular Salivary Gland: A Case Report and Literature Review.
p1756
aVSalivary gland tumours constitute about 3-4 % of all head and neck neoplasms. Approximately 80 % originate in the parotid gland and they are rarely present in the submandibular gland. Basal cell adenoma is a benign epithelial salivary gland tumour that appears to have unique histologic characteristics. The diagnosis of this entity must be established by histological study.The literature revealed only four reported cases of basal cell adenoma of submandibular salivary gland. This article presents a rarely occurring basal cell adenoma as a fifth reported case in submandibular salivary gland in a 23 year old female.A rare case of basal cell adenoma of submandibular salivary gland is reported with clinical features, diagnosis, histopathological features and treatment modalities. When there is involvement of submandibular gland with a tumour the histopathological confirmation is mandatory instead of relying on FNAC and it must be differentiated from pleomorphic adenoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, adenocarcinoma due to its prognostic implications.Entities like basal cell adenoma can only be established by histopathological examination after excisional biopsy. The treatment done also affects the ultimate prognosis. As such the surgeon has to make his clinical decision based on many factors like history, clinical examination, histopathological examinations, radiological examination and immunohistochemistry study. No single criteria should be relied upon. We recommend to carry out genetic pattern study in a person with basal cell adenoma to rule out pathogenesis and establish a correct diagnosis of it for better understanding and prognosis.

VAssessment by HPLC of the degradation behavior of acitretin under hydrolytic, oxidative, photolytic and thermal stress conditions.
p1759
aVAcitretin is a photosensitive oral retinoid with very limited data available on its degradation. The official HPLC method for acitretin determination was insufficient to resolve the degradation products generated during stability studies. Therefore, an isocratic RP-HPLC-UV method was developed for the determination of acitretin in the presence of its related impurities and degradation products. Efficient chromatographic separation was achieved on a Thermo beta-basic column C18 (100 mm×4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm) with mobile phase containing 0.3% (v/v) glacial acetic acid with acetonitrile (ACN) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in an isocratic ratio of 70:30 at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min with the eluent monitored at 360 nm. The method was validated for specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy and robustness. The calibration plot was linear over the concentration range of 50-150 \u03bcg/mL with a correlation coefficient (r (2)) of 0.999. The proposed method was used to investigate the degradation kinetics of acitretin under the different degradative conditions. The degradation rate constant (K), half-life (t 1/2), and t 90 were calculated. Degradation of acitretin followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The drug was found to be less stable under acidic and photolytic degradation conditions: the photolytic degradation constants for acitretin in sunlight and UV light were 0.002698% and 0.0008402% min(-1), respectively. The LOD for acitretin and the known impurities were at a level below 0.02%. The method shows consistent recoveries for ACTR (99.8%-101.2%) and also for its known impurities (97.2-101.3%). The method was found to be accurate, precise, linear, specific, sensitive, rugged, robust, and useful for characterizing the stability of this chemical.

VDevelopment and in vitro/in vivo evaluation of controlled release provesicles of a nateglinide-maltodextrin complex.
p1762
aVThe aim of this study was to characterize the provesicle formulation of nateglinide (NTG) to facilitate the development of a novel controlled release system of NTG with improved efficacy and oral bioavailability compared to the currently marketed NTG formulation (Glinate\u2122 60). NTG provesicles were prepared by a slurry method using the non-ionic surfactant, Span 60 (SP), and cholesterol (CH) as vesicle forming agents and maltodextrin as a coated carrier. Multilamellar niosomes with narrow size distribution were shown to be successfully prepared by means of dynamic laser scattering (DLS) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The absence of drug-excipient interactions was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. In vitro release of NTG in different dissolution media was improved compared to pure drug. A goat intestinal permeation study revealed that the provesicular formulation (F4) with an SP:CH ratio of 5:5 gave higher cumulative amount of drug permeated at 48 h compared to Glinate\u2122 60 and control. A pharmacodynamic study in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats confirmed that formulation F4 significantly (P<0.05) reduced blood glucose levels in comparison to Glinate 60. Overall the results show that controlled release NTG provesicles offer a useful and promising oral delivery system for the treatment of type II diabetes.

VPreclinical investigation of the pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and protein and red blood cell binding of DRDE-07: a prophylactic agent against sulphur mustard.
p1765
aVDRDE-07, a newly synthesized amifostine analog currently under clinical investigation in a phase I trial, is a potent antidote against sulfur mustard toxicity. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of DRDE-07 in female Swiss Albino mice after a single oral dose of 400 or 600 mg/kg. The physicochemical properties of DRDE-07, including solubility, pK a, Log P, plasma protein binding and plasma/blood partitioning, were determined to support the pharmacokinetic characterization. DRDE-07 concentration was determined by an HPLC-UV method. The profile of plasma concentration versus time was analyzed using a non-compartmental model. Plasma protein binding was assessed using ultrafiltration. DRDE-07 appeared rapidly in plasma after oral administration with peak plasma levels (C max) observed in less than 15 min. There was a rapid decline in the plasma levels followed by a smaller second peak about 90 min after dosing. The plasma protein binding of DRDE-07 was found to be less than 25% at all concentrations studied. Plasma clearance of DRDE-07 is expected to be ~1.5 fold higher than the blood clearance of DRDE-07. The probable metabolite of DRDE-07 was identified as phenyl-S-ethyl amine.

VNovel coumarin-benzimidazole derivatives as antioxidants and safer anti-inflammatory agents.
p1768
aVInspired from occurrence of anti-inflammatory activity of 3-substituted coumarins and antiulcer activity of various 2-substituted benzimidazoles, novel compounds have been designed by coupling coumarin derivatives at 3-position directly or through amide linkage with benzimidazole nucleus at 2-position. The resultant compounds are expected to exhibit both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities along with less gastric toxicity profile. Two series of coumarin-benzimidazole derivatives (4a-e and 5a-e) were synthesized and evaluated for anti-inflammatory activity and antioxidant activity. Compounds 4c, 4d and 5a displayed good anti-inflammatory (45.45%, 46.75% and 42.85% inhibition, respectively, versus 54.54% inhibition by indomethacin) and antioxidant (IC50 of 19.7, 13.9 and 1.2 µmol/L, respectively, versus 23.4 µmol/L for butylatedhydroxytoluene) activities. Evaluation of ulcer index and in vivo biochemical estimations for oxidative stress revealed that compounds 4d and 5a remain safe on gastric mucosa and did not induce oxidative stress in tissues. Calculation of various molecular properties suggests the compounds to be sufficiently bioavailable.

VPharmacokinetic aspects and in vitro-in vivo correlation potential for lipid-based formulations.
p1771
aVLipid-based formulations have been an attractive choice among novel drug delivery systems for enhancing the solubility and bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs due to their ability to keep the drug in solubilized state in the gastrointestinal tract. These formulations offer multiple advantages such as reduction in food effect and inter-individual variability, ease of preparation, and the possibility of manufacturing using common excipients available in the market. Despite these advantages, very few products are available in the present market, perhaps due to limited knowledge in the in vitro tests (for prediction of in vivo fate) and lack of understanding of the mechanisms behind pharmacokinetic and biopharmaceutical aspects of lipid formulations after oral administration. The current review aims to provide a detailed understanding of the in vivo processing steps involved after oral administration of lipid formulations, their pharmacokinetic aspects and in vitro in vivo correlation (IVIVC) perspectives. Various pharmacokinetic and biopharmaceutical aspects such as formulation dispersion and lipid digestion, bioavailability enhancement mechanisms, impact of excipients on efflux transporters, and lymphatic transport are discussed with examples. In addition, various IVIVC approaches towards predicting in vivo data from in vitro dispersion/precipitation, in vitro lipolysis and ex vivo permeation studies are also discussed in detail with help of case studies.

VRuptured rudimentary horn pregnancy with a history of an uneventful vaginal delivery.
p1774
aVPregnancy in a rudimentary uterine horn is a rare event with an estimated incidence of 1 in 76,000 to 1 in 1,40,000 pregnancies. Unicornuate uterus with a rudimentary horn has a high incidence of obstetric and gynecological complications. Ruptured ectopic pregnancy in the rudimentary horn is one of the most dreaded complications, which can have grave consequences for both mother and fetus. In the majority of the cases, it is detected after rupture of the horn, usually during the first or second trimester of pregnancy. An ultrasonographic diagnosis made prior to rupture of the rudimentary horn may prevent this catastrophic outcome. We report a case of a G2 P1 L1 with a ruptured left rudimentary horn pregnancy at 16 weeks of gestation that was misdiagnosed as a pregnancy in the left uterine horn of a bicornuate uterus on prior prenatal ultrasound. The patient presented to our hospital with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. A diagnosis of ruptured left rudimentary horn pregnancy was made on the basis of emergency ultrasound and was later confirmed on laparotomy. The left rudimentary horn along with the ipsilateral fallopian tube was excised.

VAn in vivo transcriptome data set of natural antisense transcripts from Plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates.
p1778
aVAntisense transcription is pervasive among biological systems and one of the products of antisense transcription is natural antisense transcripts (NATs). Emerging evidences suggest that they are key regulators of gene expression. With the discovery of NATs in Plasmodium falciparum, it has been suggested that these might also be playing regulatory roles in this parasite. However, all the reports describing the diversity of NATs have come from parasites in culture condition except for a recent study published by us. In order to explore the in vivo diversity of NATs in P. falciparum clinical isolates, we performed a whole genome expression profiling using a strand-specific 244 K microarray that contains probes for both sense and antisense transcripts. In this report, we describe the experimental procedure and analysis thereof of the microarray data published recently in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE44921. This published data provide a wealth of information about the prevalence of NATs in P. falciparum clinical isolates from patients with diverse malaria related disease conditions. Supplementary information about the description and interpretation of the data can be found in a recent publication by Subudhi et al. in Experimental Parasitology (2014).

VIdentifying Early Onset of Hearing Loss in Young Adults With Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 Using High Frequency Audiometry.
p1781
aVDiabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder caused by hyperglycemia which leads to dysfunction of various organs. Hearing acuity is equally hindered by this disorder. Among individuals with DM audiological characteristics of DM type 1 are of great concern in the literature. This study aims at establishing high frequency audiometry (HFA) as a useful tool in identifying early onset of hearing loss in individuals with DM type 2. 20 non-diabetic participants and 20 individuals with DM type 2 in the age range of 20-40 years were considered for the study. Subjects in both groups underwent otoscopic examination, PTA at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 kHz and HFA at 9, 10, 11.2, 12.5, 14 and 16 kHz. Results revealed statistically significant difference in thresholds of both PTA and HFA at all frequencies across the group, but the mean threshold difference between the diabetic and non-diabetic group was marked in HFA than in PTA. In the diabetic subjects the thresholds of PTA was within 25 dBHL at all frequencies when compared to the thresholds of HFA. Individuals with DM type 2 showed bilateral symmetrical mild hearing loss in HFA and the hearing loss increased with ascending test frequencies from 9,000 to 16,000 Hz. Mild hearing loss in HFA is an indicator for early onset of hearing loss in DM type 2. Hence this present study emphasis the clinical utility of HFA in young adults with DM type 2.

p1784
aVAlthough interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection are being increasingly implemented as a part of national guideline, the prevalence of pediatric HIV remains high. There is remarkable increase in survival if HIV-infected children have access to early infant diagnosis (EID) and treatment.The study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Medical College, Kolkata from July 2011 to February 2014 after obtaining approval from the institutional ethics committee. All the infants of HIV-positive mothers who came for EID between 6 weeks to 18 months of age during the study period were included in the study. A total number of 151 infants were included in the study and divided into Group A and B according to the time of first testing. It was a prospective observational longitudinal study. Data were collected from the EID register of PPTCT unit Medical College Kolkata. EID was done as laid out in the pediatric ART (anti-retroviral therapy) guidelines of the National AIDS Control Organization.Effectiveness of EID is judged by the corroboration of results at 6 week, 6 and 18 months. Comparing the results in group A, we found that 10.26, 8.41, and 7.29 % were positive at 6 weeks, 6 and 18 months, respectively, and with p value of 0.5828 the differences were not statistically significant. In group B, we observed that 47.06 and 45.45 % were positive at 6 and 18 months, respectively. Analysis revealed a p value of 0.9072 indicating no significant statistical difference between the results of testing in different periods. This reflects a good correlation between the 6 weeks, 6 and 18 months value, thus establishing the integrity of the EID.Ultimate integrity of the PPTCT is judged by testing the child. EID is a novel procedure which aims at earlier diagnosis and initiation of treatment in the children.

VSeroprevalence and Influence of Torch Infections in High Risk Pregnant Women: A Large Study from South India.
p1790
aVThe increased complications to the mother and fetus during or after pregnancy and birth are often caused by a wide array of pathogenic organisms mostly belonging to the TORCH group [toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV)]. These agents cause asymptomatic or mild infection in the mother while serious consequences in fetus. The present study was aimed to find significant etiological pathogens in the causation of high risk pregnancy (HRP) in South Indian population.A total of 1,158 HRP women (2010-2013) from Modern Government Maternity Hospital, Hyderabad were considered. Two milliliter of blood was obtained and the serum was analyzed for IgG and IgM antibodies against TORCH agents by ELISA.Twenty-five percent of the study group had fetal congenital malformation in the present pregnancy (Group 1; N = 291) while 75 % showed bad obstetric history (BOH) (Group 2; N = 867). Maternal age of \u226425 years, primi gravida, and consanguinity showed predisposing role for Group 1 while maternal age \u226530 years and \u2265 3 gravida were contributing risk for Group 2. The seropositvity in HRP women for toxoplasma, rubella, CMV, and HSV was 28, 84, 92, and 61 %, respectively for IgG while it was 6, 3, 4, and 3 % for IgG + IgM. Total seropositvity of toxoplasma, rubella, CMV, and HSV in Group 1 was 29, 97, 97, and 62 % while it was 36, 84, 97, and 65 % in Group 2, respectively.Maternal age of \u226425 years, primi gravida, and consanguinity contributed to fetal congenital malformation in the present pregnancy while maternal age of \u226530 years and \u2265 3 gravida towards BOH. Toxoplasma is protective while rubella and CMV are the infectious agents for HRP. Among the groups, toxoplasma and rubella conferred a predisposing risk towards Group 2 and Group 1, respectively. Sixty-one percent seropositvity of HSV in relation to bad obstetric outcome is the highest prevalence reported so far in India.

Body weight was assessed on day 1, 7 and 14, whereas locomotion, anxiety and depression were assessed at the end of the experiment.Administration of 3-NP induces HD like symptoms and produced a significant decrease in body weight on day 7 (P < 0.01)and day 14 (P < 0.001), further decreased locomotion, time spent and number of entries in light area as well as increased immobility period were observed. The rats treated with lycopene and quercetin alone significantly restore the body weight and locomotion count as well as alleviate anxiety and depression. However, combination treatment of lycopene and quercetin with and without poloxamer 188 produced more significant effect on body weight compared to Huntington control rats, but no significant effect was found between the treated groups. However, significant increased on locomotion, time spent and number of entries in light area and decreased immobility period was observed in the combination treated groups when compared to single drug therapy.Combination treatment of lycopene and quercetin with and without poloxamer 188 in HD more effectively alleviate anxiety and depression than single drug therapy.

aVThe aim was to test whether the ethanolic extract of Fumaria indica (FI) possesses anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities, and fumaric acid (FA) could be one of its bioactive constituent involved in such activities of the extract.For anti-inflammatory activity, carrageenan-induced edema and cotton pellet induced granuloma tests in rats and for analgesic activity rat tail flick test and hot plate and acetic acid writhing tests in mice were used. All tests were performed after seven daily oral doses of the FI extract (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day) and pure FA (1.25, 2.50, and 5.00 mg/kg/day).Anti-inflammatory activities of FI and FA were observed in carrageenan-induced edema and cotton pallet granuloma even after their lowest tested doses. No analgesic activity of lowest tested dose of FA was observed in the acetic acid writhing test, but likewise, all tested dose levels of FI, higher tested dose levels of FA were also possess significant analgesic activity in this test. Further, significant analgesic activities of both FI and FA in hot plate and tale flick tests were observed after all their tested doses.These observations are in agreement with our working hypothesis on the connection of FA in mode(s) of action(s) of FI, and reaffirm the conviction that FI could be an herbal alternative against fibromyalgia and other pathologies often associate with, or caused by, inflammatory processes.

VEffect of Deviated Nasal Septum on Mean Platelet Volume: A Prospective Study.
p1810
aVIn E.N.T clinical practice, patients with nasal obstruction due to deviated nasal septum is a common presentation. Nasal airway obstruction is a common cause of upper airway obstruction further leading to obstructive and hypoxic manifestations. Mean platelet volume (MPV) levels increase in hypoxic conditions. MPV is one of the platelet activation index which reflects the platelet production rate. Present prospective study conducted in the department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck surgery, Gandhi Medical College and Hamidia Hospital, Bhopal, on 63 patients with the clinical evidence of DNS and 63 healthy age matched subjects as control group, aimed to evaluate the relationship between MPV levels and nasal obstruction due to deviated nasal septum (DNS). The diagnosis of patients with DNS was based on anterior rhinoscopy and endoscopic nasal examination. Blood samples were collected before surgical correction. In present study, the authors found that there is preponderance of DNS in the age group of 25-45 years being the most active age group, males having the higher incidence. Majority of cases of DNS being left sided and of obstructed type. MPV were significantly higher in patients with DNS than the control group. Among the cases MPV being higher in females and in the impacted type of DNS. Present study reemphasized the concept that MPV is increased in chronic nasal obstruction due to DNS and this increase is in accordance with the severity of DNS.

aVHearing is an essential sensory sense of an individual for development of speech which is crucial for verbal communication and personality development. It is the second most common form of disability after loco motor disability in India. Disabling hearing loss is more than 40 dB hearing loss in better ear in a person more than 15 years of age and greater than 30 dB hearing loss in better hearing ear below 14 years of age. WHO estimated 360 million individuals in the world with disabling hearing loss, out of which 91 % are adults and only 9 % are children. Early and accurate identification of birth asphyxia, hyperbilirubinemia, auditory neuropathy Presbyacusis and avoiding noise pollution and discouraging use of mobile phone, tobacco chewing/smoking, in those who are prone to deafness, an intervention is a must to decrease deafness from our society. Deafness prevention can only be possible with mutual cooperation with dedication of different medical and non-medical personnel and also by helping the persons with deafness. We have to focus not only on the children but also on senior citizens as most alarming, up to 40 %, incidence of deafness is in senior citizens above the age of 75 years. Timely cure and preventive measures are essential for better socio-economic state of the country. By helping the persons with deafness, we will not only be doing a great service to the Nation but also to the society at large.

aVRetrograde urethrogram is employed for adequate demonstration of anterior urethral stricture and is commonly performed by trainee residents. Not uncommonly, contrast is injected under pressure to overcome the resistance of a stricture which can lead to extravasation or intravasation exposing the patient to risk of bacteremia, sepsis, contrast reactions, and worsening of stricture. We report two such cases of extensive intravasation delineating the "venogram" of peno-pelvic venous arcade. Such rare occurrences highlight the importance of eliciting history of various allergies and asthma, urethral instrumentation, obtaining sterile urine before the study, and performing the study under dynamic fluoroscopy.

VGiant Retroperitoneal Lymphangioma: a Rare Entity.
p1831
aVRetroperitoneal lymphangiomas are rare benign tumors, and the exact incidence of which is not well known. They usually arise from the developmental abnormalities of retroperitoneal lymphatics or their traumatic rupture. Confusion with other cystic tumors of the retroperitoneum including those arising from the kidney and pancreas is common. They usually lack specific symptoms and are mostly detected accidentally, while very rarely, some may present with complications such as rupture, torsion, hemorrhage, or infection. We report a case of a 22-year-old female in whom preoperative diagnosis of retroperitoneal lymphangioma was made on the basis of radiological investigations. On exploration, a large lymphangioma arising retroperitoneally was identified and excised. Postoperative recovery was uneventful.

VAppraisal of Laparoscopic Liver Resection in the Treatment of Liver Metastasis with Special Reference to Outcome in Colorectal Malignancies.
p1834
aVTreatment of metastatic liver disease is at the crossroads of an evolutionary transformation with more and more reports reiterating the benefits of resectional therapy in various cancers. A quest for application of laparoscopic approaches to the management of liver metastasis has arisen due to the projected benefits of less morbidity, early recovery, and equivalent oncological outcome in selected malignancies. However, the diverse and heterogenous data on indications, operative technique, and outcome evaluation make a comparative analysis of these studies difficult. This review is an appraisal of technique and outcome of minimally invasive liver resection as reported in the current literature with special reference to treatment of metastatic colorectal cancers.

VPost-Resection Surveillance in GI Cancers.
p1837
aVRecurrence after curative resection of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers is common. Early detection of resectable recurrences may result in a curative resection. In un-resectable recurrences, early detection may improve the quality of life by palliation or with the use of newer chemotherapeutic drugs. The guidelines regarding follow-up of patients after curative resection of GI cancers are from the West which is very different from the Indian population in terms of a disease pattern and social milieu. The guidelines which are commonly used are also not strictly followed. We have proposed in this article the protocols which we follow at our centre after curative resection of GI cancer and how these are different from the guidelines proposed by the West.

Music therapy has been used for various therapeutic reasons like Alzheimer's disease,Hypertension and mental disorders to name a few. We conducted a study to establish the effect of the classical ragam Anandhabhairavi on post operative pain relief. A randomized controlled study involving 60 patients who were to undergo surgery was conducted at PSG Institute of Medical Sciences and Research,Coimbatore.30 patients selected at random and were exposed to the ragam Anandhabhairavi which was played in their room pre operatively (from the day they got admitted for surgery) and 3 days post operatively. The control group did not listen to the music during their stay in the hospital. An observation chart was attached in which the requirement of analgesics by the patient was recorded. On completion of the study and on analysis,the ragam Anandhabhairavi had a significant effect in post operative pain management which was evidenced by the reduction in analgesic requirement by 50 % in those who listened to the ragam.A significant p value of <0.001 was obtained.

p1847
aVThe aim of this study was to analyze anatomy of the celiac trunk through its diameter, length, and variation of its branches. We studied 40 cadavers (25 males and 15 females) in the various colleges in the west India for the variation in the celiac trunk. Dissection of the celiac trunk was performed after opening of the peritoneal cavity. The length of the celiac trunk up to the common hepatic artery was observed. Diameter of the celiac trunk and distance between the celiac trunk and the superior mesenteric artery were observed. We found cases of rare vascular variation in the branching pattern and the common hepatic artery, which arises from the superior mesenteric artery and there is abnormal relation between the common hepatic artery portal vein and the bile duct. In a case we have observed that the superior mesenteric artery gives acute angulations downward on the right side. This type of study of celiac trunk and presence of variation in hepatic arteries will allow the surgeon to practice safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy, liver resections, or vascular recombination in transplantation and, thereby, avoid errors and patient morbidity.

aVGanglion cysts are tense,smooth,fluctuant,cystic and transilluminant swellings. They are commonly found on the dorsum of the wrist, at the scapholunate articulation and may involve volar wrist, tendon sheaths and even inter phalangeal joints. This study aims to compare the efficacy and the recurrence rates with triamcinolone, hyaluronidase and sodium tetradecyl sulphate,using the single dart technique. This prospective observational study was conducted on patients who presented to the general surgery outpatient department of our institute with ganglion cysts of wrist between January 2010 and August 2011 (20 months). A total of 180 patients were included in this study. The difference in the recurrence rates after sclerotherapy for ganglion cysts is statistically not significant between triamcinolone and hyaluronidase regimens as Z (P1-P2)\u2009=\u20091.70, p\u2009>\u20090.05 but the difference in the recurrence rates after sclerotherapy for ganglion cysts is statistically significant between triamcinolone and sodium tetradecyl sulphate regimens as Z (P1-P2)\u2009=\u20093.34, p\u2009<\u20090.05 . Chi-square value -10.33 (2 ° of freedom), p\u2009=\u20090.00571987 (significant at 5 % level). Intralesional injection of triamcinolone by single dart technique, therefore, may be considered as a simple, safe, cost effective, convenient, less invasive alternative to surgical excision of wrist ganglion cysts.

aVThe purpose of study is to analyze the feasibility, utility, and advantage of using alternate methods of anesthesia in patients undergoing surgeries for minor anorectal ailments. A total of 60 cases with proctoscopic findings of low fistula in ano, fissure in ano, hemorrhoids grade II and grade III, were operated between October 2005 and April 2007. Patients were randomized and divided into two groups of 30 each. Group A underwent surgeries under local anesthesia while group B under spinal anesthesia. There was no significant difference in operating time and patient satisfaction score. Postoperative urinary retention was significantly higher in group B-30 % patients in group B versus 6.7 % in group A. Hospital stay was significantly decreased in group A, with 93.3 % patients discharged on day 1 as compared to 70 % in group B (P = 0.02). Surgeries under local anesthesia were beneficial in terms of hospital stay and postoperative complications like urinary retention. No significant difference in patient satisfaction was observed. Hence, compared to spinal anesthesia, local anesthesia is a safe and advantageous technique in performing minor anorectal surgeries.

Compared to 2008 (no incentives, n = 2492), the patients registered with incentives in 2011 had higher treatment success (88% vs. 79%, P < 0.001) and lower proportions of unsuccessful outcomes: loss to follow-up (5% vs. 10%, P < 0.001), death (5% vs. 6%, P = 0.03) and failure (2% vs. 5%, P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis (log-binomial regression) using the intention-to-treat approach, provision of incentives was independently associated with an overall reduction in unsuccessful outcomes of 50% (RR 0.5, 95%CI 0.45-0.62, P < 0.001), after adjusting for other confounders such as sex, age, education, occupation, residence, homelessness, type of TB and human immunodeficiency virus status.Provision of incentives to TB patients significantly improved treatment success rates and needs to continue. Treatment retention increased, thus potentially preventing drug resistance, a serious problem in the Republic of Moldova.

About two thirds of patients were unemployed or retired, 7% were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive and 35% had a history of alcohol use. Treatment success was achieved in 2167 (88%) patients. Older age, unemployment, HIV infection and alcohol use were found to be independently associated with unsuccessful treatment (death, loss to follow-up, failure, transfer out and other). For many variables, including HIV infection, diabetes mellitus and tobacco use, it was not possible to distinguish between 'not recorded' and 'not present' in the registry.The treatment success rate among new drug-susceptible TB patients exceeded the 85% global target for TB control. Additional attention and support is required for most vulnerable patients, such as those who are unemployed or retired, HIV infected and alcohol users. The National TB Registry should be revised to improve definitions and staff should be trained for proper data collection and recording.

A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess risk factors for time to LFU.Among 1593 patients, 458 (29%) were lost to follow-up. A total of 1240 MDR-TB patients were included in the final analysis (845 treatment success, 395 LFU). Over 40% of LFU occurred during the first 8 months of MDR-TB treatment; 40% of patients had not achieved culture conversion at the time of LFU. In multivariate analysis, the factors associated with LFU included male sex, illicit drug use, tobacco use, history of previous anti-tuberculosis treatment, site of TB disease, and place and year of initiating treatment.LFU was high among MDR-TB patients in Georgia and posed a significant public health risk, as many were culture-positive at the time of LFU. A multi-pronged approach is needed to address the various patient- and treatment-related characteristics associated with LFU.

Among 439 patients who started treatment (84% males, median age 45 years, 15% HIV-infected), 291 (66%) had unsuccessful outcomes (35% deaths, 18% treatment failure and 13% lost to follow-up). Multivariate regression analysis showed that patients aged \u2a7e45 years (aRR 1.2, 95%CI 1.1-1.3), HIV-infected patients and those not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) (aRR 1.5, 95%CI 1.4-1.6) and those with a previous history of anti-tuberculosis treatment (aRR 1.2, 95%CI 1.1-1.4) had significantly higher risk of unsuccessful outcomes.Treatment outcomes among MDR-TB patients were poor, with high rates of death, failure and loss to follow-up (including pre-treatment loss to follow-up). Urgent measures to increase ART uptake among HIV-infected MDR-TB patients, improved access to second-line anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing and comprehensive patient support measures are required to address this grim situation.

In this Review, we provide evidence for mental health interventions in schools in accordance with a public mental health approach spanning promotion, prevention, and treatment. We identified a systematic review for mental health promotion, and identified further prevention and treatment studies. Present evidence supports schools as places for promotion of positive aspects of mental health using a whole-school approach. Knowledge of effectiveness of prevention and treatment interventions is more widely available for conflict-affected children and adolescents. More evidence is needed to identify the many elements likely to be associated with effective prevention and treatment for children exposed to a range of adversity and types of mental disorders. Dissemination and implementation science is crucial to establish how proven effective interventions could be scaled up and implemented in schools.

VThe Molecular and Structural Basis of HBV-resistance to Nucleos(t)ide Analogs.
p1877
aVInfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a worldwide health problem. Chronic hepatitis B can lead to fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Management of the latter two conditions often requires liver transplantation. Treatment with conventional interferon or pegylated interferon alpha can clear the virus, but the rates are very low. The likelihood, however, of viral resistance to interferon is minimal. The main problems with this therapy are the frequency and severity of side effects. In contrast, nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) have significantly lower side effects, but require long term treatment as sustained virological response rates are extremely low. However, long term treatment with NAs increases the risk for the development of anti-viral drug resistance. Only by understanding the molecular basis of resistance and using agents with multiple sites of action can drugs be designed to optimally prevent the occurrence of HBV antiviral resistance.

VHas Oxidative Stress any Role on Mechanisms of Aminophylline-Induced Seizures? An Animal Study.
p1892
aVAminophylline can trigger seizures in patients without known underlying epilepsy or added risk factor for seizure exacerbation in epilepsy. Most of these seizures are difficult to control and are underappreciated compared to other drug toxicities. Despite a long clinical history of aminophylline-induced seizures, relatively little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to methylxanthine-induced seizure generation.The present study evaluated the possible involvement of free radicals in aminophylline induced seizures in rat.The rats were divided into two groups. The first group graded single doses of aminophylline from 100 to 300 mg/kg were administered intraperitoneally. On the basis of the results Aminophylline, a dose (300 mg/kg) producing tonic-clonic seizures and mortality in 100% animals was selected as control in the study. The second group were subjected to single antioxidant (Vitamin E or Vitamin C) or in combination for 45 days then single doses of aminophylline 300 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally to rats.Aminophylline induced convulsions in rats in a dose-dependent manner, and both incidence of seizure and mortality were maximum at 300 mg/kg and there was significant increase of free radical generation. But though pre-treatment with antioxidants showed differential attenuating effects on aminophylline induced free radical generation as we all known but they were very much ineffective in antagonizing aminophylline induced seizures and post-seizure mortality by any appreciable extent.Though Aminophylline induces oxidative stress the results are suggestive that at least free radicals is not only cause of convulsiogenic effects and post-seizure mortality of aminophylline.

aVNepal is promoting safe motherhood through maternity incentives schemes. Still about two-thirds of births take place at home. Inadequate access to health care and under utilization of services is the major reasons for poor health of women and children.The study aim to explore the barriers in utilization of maternal health care services in eastern Nepal specifically to explore the reasons for not availing the services and to assess the indigenous practices regarding maternal health.An exploratory study design was adopted to elicit the information from the selected respondents from different villages. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were conducted. Data was transcribed and analyzed manually to identify themes.The barriers to maternal health care service utilization were identified as social factors like family pressure, superstition, shyness, misconception, negligence, illiteracy, alcoholism. Likewise, large family size, jobless, unnecessary expenditure on health services was identified as economic barrier. Some cultural practices were also found as barrier for not availing the health services.The study explored factors that are contributing in not availing the maternal health care services. The elimination of these barriers will facilitate quality of care and health outcomes. Therefore, the interventions should be developed and implemented to improve the health status of women and children. The result of this study can be utilized to draw the attention of local government, in strategic planning related to maternal health interventions.

Method This cross sectional study was conducted among male police personnel residing in urban Puducherry, India. Data on blood pressure (BP), anthropometric measurements, demographic factors, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, stress level, obesity and dietary factors were collected by interview technique using a standard questionnaire.About 296 police personnel were participated. Most of them belonged to the age group of 25-39 years (68%). The prevalence of pre-hypertension and hypertension was 37.8% and 34.5% respectively. Among those with hypertension, 56.86% (58/102) were known hypertensives and 43.13% (44/102) were newly diagnosed. Age group of 50-59 years (AOR=8.472) and 40-49 years (AOR=8.15), currently using alcohol (AOR=1.797), less than 7 servings of fruits in a week (AOR=3.228), moderate stress level (AOR=2.374) and waist circumference more than 90 cm (AOR=4.937) were associated with higher prevalence of hypertension among police personnel.Hypertension among Police personnel is comparatively higher than general population in this area. Reduction in alcohol use, increase in fruit servings along with other lifestyle modification measures may help in prevention and control of hypertension.

VEpidemiological Modeling of Bovine Brucellosis in India.
p1910
aVThe study objective is to develop an epidemiological model of brucellosis transmission dynamics among cattle in India and to estimate the impact of different prevention and control strategies. The prevention and control strategies are test-and-slaughter, transmission rate reduction, and mass vaccination. We developed a mathematical model based on the susceptible-infectious-recovered epidemic model to simulate brucellosis transmission dynamics, calibrated to the endemically stable levels of bovine brucellosis prevalence of cattle in India. We analyzed the epidemiological benefit of different rates of reduced transmission and vaccination. Test-and-slaughter is an effective strategy for elimination and eradication of brucellosis, but socio-cultural constraints forbid culling of cattle in India. Reducing transmission rates lowered the endemically stable levels of brucellosis prevalence correspondingly. One-time vaccination lowered prevalence initially but increased with influx of new susceptible births. While this epidemiological model is a basic representation of brucellosis transmission dynamics in India and constrained by limitations in surveillance data, this study illustrates the comparative epidemiological impact of different bovine brucellosis prevention and control strategies.

VLow Density Lipid Nanoparticles for Solid Tumor Targeting.
p1913
aVOne of the most significant characteristics of cancer cells is their rapid dividing ability and overexpression of LDL receptors, which offers an opportunity for the selective targeting of these cells. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)-encapsulated low density lipid nanoparticles (LDLN) were prepared by the emulsion congealing method which mimics the plasma-derived LDL by acquiring the apolipoprotein B-100 from the blood. The average particle size, transmission electron microscope (TEM), and drug content of the prepared LDLN dispersion were found to be 161±3.5 nm, with spherical shape, and 0.370±0.05 mg/mL, respectively. In vitro release studies revealed a sustained profile which decreased with a lapse of time. In vivo studies of 5-FU serum concentration and biodistribution revealed a 5-FU serum concentration of 8.5% in tumor cells and about 2.1% in the liver at the end of 24 hr from LDLN. Tumor growth suppression studies showed 185.42% average tumor growth and 89.76% tumor height as compared to the control exhibiting tumor growth at 1166.47% and tumor height at 176.07%. On the basis of these collective data, it is suggested that a higher accumulation of LDLN, when given as an IV, in solid tumors is attributed to the active uptake of LDLN via LDL receptors via apolipoprotein B-100.

p1916
aVA simple, rapid, and highly selective RP-HPLC method was developed for the simultaneous determination of Ambrisentan (AMB) and Tadalafil (TADA) drug substances in the fixed dosage strength of 10 mg and 40 mg, respectively. Effective chromatographic separation was achieved using a Hypersil GOLD C18 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm internal diameter, 5 \u03bcm particle size) with a mobile phase composed of methanol, water, and acetonitrile in the ratio of 40:40:20 (by volume). The mobile phase was pumped using a gradient HPLC system at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, and quantification of the analytes was based on measuring their peak areas at 260 nm. The retention times for Ambrisentan and Tadalafil were about 2.80 and 7.10 min, respectively. The reliability and analytical performance of the proposed HPLC procedure were statistically validated with respect to system suitability, linearity, ranges, precision, accuracy, specificity, robustness, detection, and quantification limits. Calibration curves were linear in the ranges of 1-20 \u03bcg/mL for Ambrisentan and 4-80 \u03bcg/mL for Tadalafil with correlation coefficients >0.990. The proposed method proved to be selective and stability-indicating by the resolution of the two analytes from the forced degradation (hydrolysis, oxidation, and photolysis) products. The validated HPLC method was successfully applied to the analysis of AMB and TADA in pharmaceutical dosage form.

aVA selenolate-protected Ag-Pd alloy cluster was synthesized using a one-pot solution-phase route. The crude product upon chromatographic analyses under optimized conditions gave three distinct clusters with unique optical features. One of these exhibits a molecular peak centered at m/z 2839, in its negative ion mass spectrum assigned to Ag5Pd4(SePh)12(-), having an exact match with the corresponding calculated spectrum. Tandem mass spectrometry of the molecular ion peak up to MS(9) was performed. Complex isotope distributions in each of the mass peaks confirmed the alloy composition. We find the Ag3Pd3(-) core to be highly stable. The composition was further supported by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

VExperimental Determination of the Electrostatic Nature of Carbonyl Hydrogen-Bonding Interactions Using IR-NMR Correlations.
p1922
aVHydrogen-bonding plays a fundamental role in the structure, function, and dynamics of various chemical and biological systems. Understanding the physical nature of interactions and the role of electrostatics in hydrogen-bonding has been the focus of several theoretical and computational research. We present an experimental approach involving IR-(13)C NMR correlations to determine the electrostatic nature of carbonyl hydrogen-bonding interactions. This report provides a direct experimental evidence of the classical nature of hydrogen-bonding interaction in carbonyls, independent of any theoretical approximation. These results have important implications in chemistry and biology and can be applied to probe the reaction mechanisms involving carbonyl activation/stabilization by hydrogen bonds using spectroscopic techniques.

VAcademic Medical Centers as digital health catalysts.
p1931
aVEmerging digital technologies offer enormous potential to improve quality, reduce cost, and increase patient-centeredness in healthcare. Academic Medical Centers (AMCs) play a key role in advancing medical care through cutting-edge medical research, yet traditional models for invention, validation and commercialization at AMCs have been designed around biomedical initiatives, and are less well suited for new digital health technologies. Recently, two large bi-coastal Academic Medical Centers, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) through the Center for Digital Health Innovation (CDHI) and Partners Healthcare through the Center for Connected Health (CCH) have launched centers focused on digital health innovation. These centers show great promise but are also subject to significant financial, organizational, and visionary challenges. We explore these AMC initiatives, which share the following characteristics: a focus on academic research methodology; integration of digital technology in educational programming; evolving models to support "clinician innovators"; strategic academic-industry collaboration and emergence of novel revenue models.

VEffect of starter cultures and packaging methods on amino acid profile and eating quality characteristics of pork ham.
p1934
aVWet cured pork hams were inoculated with a mixed starter cultures comprising of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Micrococcus varians M483 at the dose level of 106 cfu/g and the un inoculated hams served as controls. The amino acid profile of hams of the treated and the control groups stored at 4oC under MAP and VP and evaluated on 60th day of storage revealed that treated hams liberated higher concentration of free amino acids except for proline and methionine which were found in higher concentration (P\u2009<\u20090.01) in the MAP control samples. The MAP control samples liberated glutamic acid (85.65\u2009±\u20091.40 ppm), cystine (21.56\u2009±\u20091.14 ppm) and tyrosine (16.63\u2009±\u20091.94 ppm) whereas, the treated samples did not release these amino acids. The VP control samples too liberated cystine (6.98\u2009±\u20091.36 ppm) and arginine (42.70\u2009±\u20092.78 ppm) but the treated ham of the VP did not liberate these amino acids. The VP hams had higher concentration (P\u2009<\u20090.01) of free proline, glycine, alanine, valine, methionine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, lysine and histidine than the MAP samples. Colour analysis of ham using CIE Lab colour system revealed that the treated samples had significantly higher concentrations of L*, a* and b* components. The L* and a* values were higher in the MAP than under VP systems while the b* values were higher in the VP samples than the MAP samples. Neither the bacterial cultures nor the packaging system influenced the textural property of ham. Starter cultures inoculated hams were rated superior (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in terms of their sensory properties. Hams packaged under MAP were rated superior (P\u2009<\u20090.05) than those packaged under VP in terms of appearance, colour, taste, tenderness, flavour, juiciness and overall acceptability.

VEvaluation of antibiofilm effect of benzalkonium chloride, iodophore and sodium hypochlorite against biofilm of Pseudomonas aeruginosa of dairy origin.
p1937
aVThe present study was undertaken with objectives of; a) to investigate and compare Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from two dairies for biofilm formation potential and, b) to compares three common biocides for biofilm eradication efficiencies. Amongst the isolates from commercial dairy, 70 % were strong and/or moderate biofilm former in comparison to 40 % isolates from small scale dairy. All isolates, irrespective of source, exhibited higher susceptibility to biocides in planktonic stage than in biofilm. Antibiofilm efficiencies of three biocides i.e. benzalkonium chloride, sodium hypochlorite and iodophore were determined in terms of their microbial biofilms eradicating concentration (MBEC). Our findings show that the three biocides were ineffective against preformed biofilms at recommended in-use concentrations. Biofilms were the most resistant to benzalkonium chloride and least against iodophore. A trend of decreasing MBECs was observed with extended contact time. The findings of present study warrant for a systematic approach for selecting types and concentrations of biocide for application as antibiofilm agent in food industry.

VDetection and quantitative determination of diethylene glycol in ethyl alcohol using gamma- ray spectroscopy.
p1940
aVDetermination of the toxic diethylene glycol contamination in ethyl alcohol demands a rapid, accurate and reliable method. Diethylene glycol (DEG) ingestion, accidental or intentional, can lead to death. Clinical and analytical methods used to detect diethylene glycol in alcohol require several hours to days due to tedious instrument handling and measurements. Enzymatic assays face difficulty due to analytic problems. As an alternative method of data analysis, we have used \u03b3-ray spectroscopic method to estimate the diethylene glycol contamination in alcohol by monitoring the variation in the linear and mass attenuation coefficients. This method is simple, robust, portable and can provide reliable and quantitative information about the ethyl alcohol adulterated with diethylene glycol which is of broader interest to society.

Effect of combination of additives (CA) namely dry gluten powder, sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate, fungal \u03b1-amylase on the rheological and bread making characteristics of wheat flour partly replaced with roller milled fractions of black gram was studied. With increase in the addition of straight run flour (SRF), protein rich fraction (PRF), protein and fiber rich fraction (P&FRF) from 0 to 20 %, fiber rich fraction, FRF (0-15 %), the farinograph water absorption increased and dough stability decreased; amylograph pasting temperature increased and peak viscosity decreased; bread volume decreased and crumb firmness value increased indicating adverse effect of these fractions on the rheological and bread making characteristics of wheat flour. Sensory evaluation showed that breads were acceptable only up to the level of 15 % for SRF, PRF & P&FRF and 10 % for FRF. However, when CA containing dry gluten powder, sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate and fungal \u03b1-amylase was incorporated the overall quality of the products improved. Use of these fractions increased the protein and fiber contents of bread by 1.24-1.66 and 1.48-3.79 times respectively. The results showed that possibility of utilising roller milled black gram fractions along with CA to improve the taste, texture and nutritional quality of bread.

p1946
aVCoconut water and kernel are the edible portions of the coconut. A study was carried out to evaluate the physico-chemical characteristics, phytonutrients and stability of coconut water (CW), kernel (CK) at different stages of maturity and commercial coconut products (CCP). The moisture content of CW, CK and CCP were in the range of 95-97 g 100 g(-1), 50-85 g 100 g(-1) and 0.4-3 g 100 g(-1) respectively. Fat content in CW was low (4-115 mg 100 g(-1)) whereas in kernel it was high (37-56 g 100 g(-1)). The CW was acidic in nature (pH 4.5-5.2). Ash content of CK decreased with maturity (1.0-1.5 %) whereas that of CW remained steady (0.3-0.4 g 100 g(-1)) with maturity. The total sugar content (3.9-4.6 g 100 g(-1)) and acidity (0.3-0.4 g 100 g(-1)) of CW did not change with maturity. The phenolics content increased in water (1.4-4.3 mg 100 g(-1)) and kernel with maturity (18.5-24.8 mg 100 g(-1)). The fatty acid composition of the oil extracted from the CK had increased saturated fatty acids (C12:0) (38-48 g 100 g(-1)) and decreased monounsaturated fatty acid (C18:1) (13-5 g 100 g(-1)) with maturity. The percentage of medium chain fatty acids increased with different stages of maturity (47-78 g 100 g(-1)). The CW and CK contained higher amount of phenolics (1.4-4.3 mg 100 g(-1) and 18.5-24.8 mg 100 g(-1) respectively) and total tocopherols of CK (0.14-0.59 mg 100 g(-1)) when compared to CCP. This study indicated that CW and CK could serve as valuable raw materials for the preparation of functional food supplement.

p1949
aVThe study aimed to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant activity of medium chain fatty acid (MCFA) rich-rice bran oils in comparison with native rice bran oil. Different in vitro methods were used to evaluate the free radical scavenging activity, metal chelation activity, reducing acitivity, ABTS radical scavenging activity, thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value and so on at different concentrations of the oils such as 10-100 \u03bcg/mL. Inhibition of lipid peroxidation was evaluated measuring thiobarbituric acid responsive substance (TBARS) and conjugated diene formation. All the oils showed potent antioxidant activity at 100 \u03bcg/mL concentration. TBARS formation and conjugated diene formation was lower with MCFA rich oils i.e. the inhibition of lipid peroxidation was more in MCFA rich oils than original rice bran oil. Caprylic acid rich rice bran oil showed maximum antioxidant activity in comparison to capric- and lauric acid rich rice bran oils. Overall the MCFA rich rice bran oils showed to be more potent antioxidant than rice bran oil due to their lower unsaturated fatty acid content.

aVFlaxseed imparted the evidence of health benefits in human being. Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to develop flaxseed fortified rice - corn flour blend based extruded product using twin screw extruder. The effect of roasted flaxseed flour (RFF) fortification (15-25 %), moisture content of feed (12-16 %, wb), extruder barrel temperature (120-140 °C) and screw speed (300-330 RPM) on expansion ratio (ER), breaking strength (BS), bulk density (BD) and overall acceptability (OAA) score of extrudates were investigated using central composite rotatable design (CCRD). Increased RFF level decreased the ER and OAA score significantly while increased BS and BD of extrudates (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Moisture content of extruder feed was positively related to ER (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and OAA (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and negatively related to BD (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Extruder barrel temperature was found to be negatively related to ER and OAA (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and positively related to BD (p\u2009<\u20090.1). Quadratic effect of screw speed was significantly positively related to ER (p\u2009<\u20090.01), BS (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and negatively related to BD (p\u2009<\u20090.01). 15 % RFF fortification with rice flour, 16 % moisture content (wb) of extruder feed, 120 °C extruder barrel temperature and 330 RPM of screw speed gave an optimized product of high desirability with corresponding responses as 3.08 ER, 0.53 kgf BS, 0.106 g.cm(-3) BD and 7.86 OAA.

aVA shelf life model based on storage temperatures was developed for a nutricereal based fermented baby food formulation. The formulated baby food samples were packaged and stored at 10, 25, 37 and 45 °C for a test storage period of 180 days. A shelf life study was conducted using consumer and semi-trained panels, along with chemical analysis (moisture and acidity). The chemical parameters (moisture and titratable acidity) were found inadequate in determining the shelf life of the formulated product. Weibull hazard analysis was used to determine the shelf life of the product based on sensory evaluation. Considering 25 and 50 % rejection probability, the shelf life of the baby food formulation was predicted to be 98 and 322 days, 84 and 271 days, 71 and 221 days and 58 and 171 days for the samples stored at 10, 25, 37 and 45 °C, respectively. A shelf life equation was proposed using the rejection times obtained from the consumer study. Finally, the formulated baby food samples were subjected to microbial analysis for the predicted shelf life period and were found microbiologically safe for consumption during the storage period of 360 days.

aVEugenol-lean fraction (98 % lower eugenol content than eugenol-rich fraction) having appreciable phytochemical properties was selectively isolated from clove buds (Syzygium aromaticum Linn) using supercritical carbon dioxide extraction at 40 °C and pressure of 25 MPa with static and dynamic time of 120 and 30 min respectively using ground clove powder which was previously subjected to steam distillation. The extract was used as a flavor ingredient (replacing mustard in classical formulation) and also as a source of natural antioxidant in formulating a new mayonnaise product to improve its nutraceutical value and shelf-life. This product was found to be comparable to the mustard formulated sample (experimental control) organoleptically. The sample did not have typical pungency of clove and had improved physical properties such as increased color tonality with higher chroma values, lower thermal and non-thermal creaming, homogenous and compact microstructure and higher consistency index vis-à-vis the control and standard market samples, even at the end of the storage period of 6 months. Mayonnaise formulated with eugenol-lean clove extract had significantly higher antioxidant activity (IC50\u2009=\u200910.85 mg/mL), phenolic content (1.89 mg gallic acid equivalent/g mayonnaise) and reducing power (11.29 mg BHT equivalent/g mayonnaise) than mustard-formulated mayonnaise and the market sample. While, the antioxidant activity and phytochemical properties tend to decrease after 30 days for the reference market sample and after 90 days for the experimental control sample, the mayonnaise formulated with eugenol-lean clove extract was found to be stable beyond 6 months.

Response surface methodology (Design expert, Trial version 8.0.5.2) was applied to the experimental data for the optimization of process variables in lactic acid fermentation of radish. Out of various treatments studied, only the treatments having ground mustard had an appreciable effect on lactic acid fermentation. Both linear and quadratic terms of the variables studied had a significant effect on the responses studied. The interactions between the variables were found to contribute to the response at a significant level. The best results were obtained in the treatment with 2.5 % salt, 1.5 % lactose, 1.5 % (MgSO4\u2009+\u2009MnSO4) and 1.5 % mustard. These optimized concentrations increased titrable acidity and LAB count, but lowered pH. The second-order polynomial regression model determined that the highest titrable acidity (1.69), lowest pH (2.49) and maximum LAB count (10\u2009×\u200910(8) cfu/ml) would be obtained at these concentrations of additives. Among 30 runs conducted, run 2 has got the optimum concentration of salt- 2.5 %, lactose- 1.5 %, MgSO4\u2009+\u2009MnSO4- 1.5 % and mustard- 1.5 % for lactic acid fermentation of radish. The values for different additives and growth stimulators optimized in this study could successfully be employed for the lactic acid fermentation of radish as a postharvest reduction tool and for product development.

p1967
aVLipase catalyzed interesterification of rice bran oil (RBO) with hydrogenated cottonseed oil (HCSO) was carried out for producing a low trans free fat. The interesterification reaction was performed by varying parameters such as weight proportions of RBO and HCSO, reaction temperatures, time period and lipase concentration. Both non specific and specific lipases namely Novozym 435 and Lipozyme TL IM were employed for this study. Based on the data generated, the optimum reaction conditions were found to be: weight proportion of RBO and HCSO, 80:20; lipase concentration, 5 % (w/w) of substrates; reaction temperature, 60 °C; reaction time, 4 h for Lipozyme TL IM and 5 h for Novozym 435. The degree of interesterification, calculated based on the results of solid fat characteristics was used for comparing the catalytic activity of Novozym 435 and Lipozyme TL IM. It was observed that the degree of interesterification (DI) reached a near 100 % at the 4th hour for reaction employing Lipozyme TL IM with a rate constant of 0.191 h(-1) while Novozym 435 catalyzed reaction reached a near 100 % degree of interesterification at the 5th hour with a rate constant of 0.187 h(-1), suggesting that Lipozyme TL IM has a faster catalytic activity.

VDevelopment of a novel cup cake with unique properties of essential oil of betel leaf (Piper betle L.) for sustainable entrepreneurship.
p1970
aVBetel vine (Piper betle L.) is a root climber with deep green heart shaped leaves. It belongs to the Piperaceae family. There is a huge wastage of the leaves during glut season and it can be reduced by various means including extraction of medicinal essential oil which can be considered as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) materials. Therefore, attempts were made to develop a novel cup cake by incorporating essential oil of betel leaf. The textural properties of the cakes were measured by texture analyzer instrument; whereas the organoleptic properties were adjudged by human preferences using sensory tables containing 9-point hedonic scale. Price estimation was done considering all costs and charges. Finally, all parameters of the developed cake were compared with different cup cakes available in the market for ascertaining consumer acceptability of the newly developed product in terms of quality and market price. Results revealed that the Novel cup cake developed with 0.005 % (v/w) essential oil of betel leaf occupied the 1st place among the four developed novel cup cakes. However, it occupied 4th place among the nine cup cakes in the overall preference list prepared based on the textural and organoleptic qualities, though its market price was calculated to be comparable to all the leading cupcakes available in the market. This indicates that manufacturing of novel cup cake with essential oil of betel leaf would be a profitable and self-sustaining entrepreneurship.

VRheological and sensory behaviour of rice flour dough: effect of selected additives in relation to dough flattening.
p1976
aVThe handling of rice flour doughs in terms of sheeting, flattening and rolling is difficult due to the absence of gluten forming proteins; scope exists to improve these characteristics by incorporating appropriate additives during the preparation of rice doughs. Different levels of additives such as whey protein concentrate (WPC) (0-10 %), xanthan gum (0-5 %), sucrose (0-20 %) and salt (0-2 %) have been incorporated, and the rheological (small-deformation oscillation) as well as sensory characteristics have been determined, in addition to microstructural observations and finding inter-relationships. The second order polynomial can adequately explain the rheological parameters like storage modulus, loss modulus and complex viscosity (R\u2009=\u20090.863-0.889, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.01) while it is poor for phase angle (R\u2009=\u20090.659, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.01). Among these additives, xanthan gum imparts the strongest effect (significant at p\u2009\u2264\u20090.01) followed by whey protein concentrate. The effects of these additives are predominantly linear though quadratic effects are also significant in several cases. A cohesive microstructure with improved binding occurs with a high level (7.5 %) of WPC. It is concluded that a judicious selection of additives in appropriate levels can develop rice doughs that possess the desirable handling properties leading to preparation of products.

aVSoybean seeds were exposed to gamma radiation (0.5, 1, 3 and 5 kGy), static magnetic field (50, 100 and 200 mT) and a combination of gamma radiation and magnetic energy (0.5 kGy\u2009+\u2009200 mT and 5 kGy\u2009+\u200950 mT) and stored at room temperature for six months. These seeds were later subjected to accelerated ageing treatment at 42 °C temperature and 95-100 % relative humidity and were compared for various physical and biochemical characteristics between the untreated and the energized treatments. Energy treatment protected the quality of stored seeds in terms of its protein and oil content . Accelerated aging conditions, however, affected the oil and protein quantity and quality of seed negatively. Antioxidant enzymes exhibited a decline in their activity during aging while the LOX activity, which reflects the rate of lipid peroxidation, in general, increased during the aging. Gamma irradiated (3 and 5 kGy) and magnetic field treated seeds (100 and 200 mT) maintained a higher catalase and ascorbate peroxidase activity which may help in efficient scavenging of deleterious free radical produced during the aging. Aging caused peroxidative changes to lipids, which could be contributed to the loss of oil quality. Among the electromagnetic energy treatments, a dose of 1-5 kGy of gamma and 100 mT, 200 mT magnetic field effectively slowed the rate of biochemical degradation and loss of cellular integrity in seeds stored under conditions of accelerated aging and thus, protected the deterioration of seed quality. Energy combination treatments did not yield any additional protection advantage.

VIntradural Neurocysticercosis of Lumbar Spine: A Case Report.
p1985
aVStudy Design\u2003Case report. Objective\u2003Cysticercosis (parasitic infection caused by Taenia solium) is the most common parasitic infection of the nervous system. However, spinal neurocysticercosis is rare. It can present as an extraspinal or intraspinal lesion, with intramedullary being the rarest location. The symptoms can vary from vague backache and radiculopathy to cauda equine syndrome. Methods\u2003We report a 32-year-old man who presented with neurocysticercosis in the lumbar spine and cauda equine syndrome. He had low backache for 1\u2009month, hesitancy in micturition, and decreased perianal sensation for the previous 2 days. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intradural extramedullary lesion extending from L2-S1 that was hyperintense in T2- and hypointense in T1-weighted images. Results\u2003Because the patient presented with cauda equine syndrome, urgent decompressive laminectomy was done from L2-S1, and the thin-walled cysts with clear fluid were removed. Histopathologic examination confirmed neurocysticercosis. The perianal sensation and the bladder control recovered completely. Conclusion\u2003Neurocysticercosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with a similar picture, and urgent surgical decompression should be attempted to prevent further worsening of the neurologic symptoms.

VBilateral Calcifying Odontogenic Cyst: A Rare Entity.
p1994
aVThe calcifying odontogenic cyst (COC) accounts for 1 % of jaw cysts, found most commonly as central lesion. The COC usually manifests itself as a painless, slow growing swelling, anterior to the first molar region. Radiographically it appears as a well-defined, unilocular radiolucency, and may have a radiopaque mass in its center. Majority of the cases appear before the fourth decade of life. The COC is found rarely in patients in the first decade of life. Histopathological features include a cystic lining demonstrating characteristic "Ghost" epithelial cells with a propensity to calcify. Here we report the unusual occurrence of a case of 8 year child diagnosed with bilateral COC on right and left side of mandible.

VAutotransplantation of Teeth Associated with Dentigerous Cyst: A Case Report.
p1997
aVThis paper discusses the treatment of impacted permanent incisors and unerupted ectopic canine associated with a dentigerous cyst in mixed dentition that was successfully managed by the combined approach of decompression followed by enucleation, primary closure, autotransplantation and endodontic therapy which enabled the utilization of teeth which were hitherto nonfunctional, transferred to an optimal functional and esthetic position. Decompression is a less invasive technique which reduces the cystic pressure, avoids a more stressful surgical procedure and necessity for general anesthesia. It gives more pleasing results as the body's own mechanism heals the defect gradually. Autotransplantation of teeth induces bone formation around the root with the help of viable periodontal ligament on their root surface. In this case, bone lost by cyst was regenerated and lamina dura was appreciable in the follow up radiographs and transplanted teeth are functioning well.

VRole of Rapid Tetanus Antibody Test in Accident and Emergency Department.
p2000
aVTetanus remains a problem of immense concern worldwide. Management of tetanus with its attendant complications are challenges to the physician and its prevention is the chief priority. The choice of tetanus prophylaxis for patients with wounds depends on obtaining their vaccination history, which has been demonstrated to be unreliable. The tetanus antibody test may avoid inadequate prophylactic measures and reduce costs.This study is conducted to determine the feasibility of rapid tetanus antibody test (SD Bioline) in the accident and emergency department.A randomized prospective study was conducted on 50 patients, divided into two groups-A and B with 25 patients each respectively. Group A had patients with a history of tetanus immunization <5 years elapsed from the last booster dose. Group B had patients who did not know the immunization status or more than 5 years elapsed from the last booster dose of tetanus immunization. Groups A and B were further classified into Group 1 and Group 2 based on whether the wound is tetanus prone or a clean wound respectively. Tetanus antibody test was done using whole-blood from the patients by finger prick.Among the 50 patients, 25 (50 %) were classified as 'unprotected' according to the history. Thirteen of the 25 patients showed tetanus antibody positive. In Group A, only 9 of the 25 patients showed tetanus antibody positive.The rapid tetanus antibody test in the emergency room could make tetanus prevention more accurate with improved technical feasibility. The test may eliminate unnecessary injecting of vaccine, reduce the cost and can be performed at the hospital setting.

VComparitive Evaluation of Propofol and Midazolam as Conscious Sedatives in Minor Oral Surgery.
p2003
aVThe objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of propofol and midazolam as an intravenous sedative agent in minor oral surgical procedures in terms of: (a) the onset of action, (b) heart rate, (c) oxygen saturation, (d) systolic and diastolic blood pressure, (e) respiratory rate, (f) pain during the injection of sedative agent, (g) recovery period, (h) side effects, (i) patient's cooperation during the surgery.This was a double blind randomized study in which one group of 20 patients received propofol with the induction dose of 0.5 mg/kg and 50 \u03bcg/kg/min which was administered by syringe infusion pump as a maintenance dose and the other group received midazolam in a single dose of 75 \u03bcg/kg and no maintenance dose was given, instead 5 % dextrose was administered by syringe infusion pump at the rate of 50 \u03bcg/kg/min. Since propofol was milky white in colour, a green cloth was covered over the infusion pump in all cases. The surgeon, assistants and observers were blind about the medications which would be given to the patient for sedation. After the administration of the sedative, local anesthesia was achieved with 2 % lignocaine hydrochloride.The onset of action in propofol group was significant as onset of action was faster. The maximum increase in heart rate in propofol group was at 10 min intraoperatively (Mean ± 80.40 ± 12.73) and that in midazolam group was at 15 min intraoperatively (Mean 79.25 ± 13.44). Post operatively the heart rate decreased near to the baseline value in both the groups. The average oxygen saturation before induction in propofol group was 99.7 ± 0.73 % and that of midazolam group was 99.15 ± 01.31 P = 0.314. None of the patients in this study developed apnea. The systolic blood pressure (Mean ± SD) before induction in both the groups decreased from the baseline value after the administration of sedatives. The diastolic blood pressure (Mean ± SD) before induction in both the groups decreased from the baseline value after the administration of sedatives and the decreased diastolic blood pressure was maintained throughout the procedure. The respiratory rate (Mean ± SD) before induction in both the groups decreased from the baseline value after the administration of sedatives. The decreased respiratory rate remained throughout the surgical procedure. Pain during the injection of the sedatives was reported by nine patients (45 %) in the propofol group whereas none of the patients in midazolam group complained of pain during the injection. This is statistically significant (P = 0.001). The recovery time (Mean ± SD) in propofol group was 22.50 ± 3.04 (range 15-25 min) and that in midazolam group was 33.75 ± 3.93 (range 30-40 min), which was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Patients in the propofol group were significantly less co-operative than midazolam group at both 10 and 25 min intra operatively.The design of the present study permitted qualitative assessment of propofol and midazolam as sedative agents in minor oral surgical procedures. The ideal anesthetic agent should provide rapid onset of action, profound intra operative amnesia while ensuring rapid recovery without much complications. There were no significant differences in either patient demographics or surgical characteristics between the two groups. The propofol group was less co-operative than midazolam group. Pain during the injection of sedative was a significant adverse effect in the propofol group. Cardiovascular parameters remained stable throughout the procedure in both study groups and no intervention was required. However recovery and onset of action was faster in the propofol group as compared with the midazolam group.

This retrospective study was carried out to evaluate the usefulness of "Kapetansky-Juri" advancement flap technique to correct such deformities.Ten patients of bilateral cleft lip with history of minimum five failed cleft lip surgeries and having residual lip deformity were operated using "Kapetansky-Juri" advancement flap technique and were followed up to minimum 36 months.All patients showed good tissue fullness and complete correction of the deformity. There was no contracture of surrounding skin or vermilion during follow-up period. In eight patients minimal scar formation was seen while two showed midline scar formation.No tissue loss due to vascular insufficiency was observed. The technique gives good tissue distribution and minimal surface scar formation.

aVThe purpose of this study was to assess the etiology, incidence, and various methods of treatment of maxillofacial injuries in children presenting at our centre and to compare our findings with literature.We carried out prospective study of 65 pediatric maxillofacial trauma patients treated from January 2011 to October 2012 at our centre. Data was collected on age, gender, etiological factors, anatomic site and treatment methods. Follow-up was performed by recall survey.Out of 65 patients 17 (26.15 %) presented with isolated soft tissue injuries and 48 (73.84 %) patients reported with 81 craniomaxillofacial fractures. Falls were most common mode of injury with 53 fractures (81.53 %). Treatment for fractures in our series comprised of periodic observation for non-displaced fractures (46.15 %), closed reduction (maxillomandibular fixation with IMF screws, acrylic cap splints) for minimally displaced fractures (15.38 %) and open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for grossly displaced fractures (12.30 %).Paediatric maxillofacial trauma can be managed conservatively and surgical treatment by ORIF is required in a very small group of children with grossly displaced fractures as a result of high velocity injuries.Prognostic study, Level II.

aVSecuring an airway in maxillofacial injuries remains a challenge and is an important objective on the part of a maxillofacial surgeon to thoroughly understand its management.The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and complications of submental intubation in the management of midfacial/panfacial trauma patients where oro-endotracheal or naso-endotracheal intubation is contraindicated and tracheostomy can be avoided.Twenty patients with maxillofacial injuries were selected for submental intubation who were admitted in Kamineni Hospital, Narketpally, Nalgonda during a 2 year period (2010-2012). The parameters used to assess the efficacy were; restoration of the occlusion, duration of the surgery, presence of scar, presence of infection, damage to vital structures or any post-operative salivary fistula.Submental intubation allowed reduction and fixation of all fractures without the interference of the tube during surgical procedure in all of the patients. There were no intra-operative complications and none of the patients required post-operative ventilation. There were no significant post-operative complications. However, in one of the cases (case 4) infection of submental wound was seen and in another case (case 11) salivary fistula was formed. Both the cases were appropriately managed without any difficulty. The submental scar was well accepted by all the patients.Submental intubation is a safe and extremely useful procedure in severe maxillofacial injuries. It presents a low incidence of operative and post operative complications. It allows both the surgeon and the anaesthetist to deliver a better quality of patient care.

VReliability of Incision Biopsy for Diagnosis of Oral Verrucous Carcinoma: A Multivariate Clinicopathological Study.
p2015
aVStudies have reported 20 % of conventional squamous cell carcinoma in patients with verrucous carcinoma (VC), later these cancers were termed as hybrid VC. It is important to distinguish both while planning treatment since hybrid VC requires addressing regional lymphatics in addition to respective surgery. Information on odds of missing the foci of invasion on routine incision biopsy might be useful in this regard.Records of all the patients surgically treated for oral cancer from Jan 2010 to Oct 2013 in a Tertiary Cancer Centre was analyzed. Patients diagnosed with primary VC or Verrucous Hyperplasia on incision biopsy were included in the study. Proportion of patients undiagnosed for invasive component on incision biopsy was calculated, multivariate analysis of the sample was performed to find associated cofounders.Fifty-five patients who reported with the diagnosis of VC (n = 53) or Verrucous Hyperplasia (n = 2) on incision biopsy were included in the study. Twenty-seven were diagnosed as VC and 28 as hybrid VC after excision. This corresponded to 51 % (n = 28) of cases missing invasive component on incision biopsy. VC was significantly more commonly seen in lip and in buccal mucosa, hybrid VC was more commonly seen in tongue and gingiva and this association was statistically significant (p = 0.031) in our study.Incision biopsy is extremely unreliable to diagnose and differentiate oral Hybrid VC from VC or Verrucous Hyperplasia. Caution is required while planning treatment of these patients regarding possibility of presence of conventional squamous cell carcinoma within these tumors.

VA Study on the Influence of the Osteotomy Slope on Bony Changes after Advancement Genioplasty.
p2018
aVThe slope of the osteotomy used for the genioplasty dictates the vertical change. The horizontal bony changes after advancement genioplasty are not identical to the intercortical bony changes, because the variety of osteotomy slopes result in different vertical changes.Ten of these patients had additional osteotomies as follows: five maxillary, three mandibular and two both maxillary and mandibular. Pre-operative and post-operative (at least 6 months) lateral cephalograms were retrospectively analyzed to assess horizontal and vertical movements of the chin. The following landmarks were used, Hard tissue pogonion (Pog), Occlusal plane (OPL), Menton (Me), Menton plane (MePL). The following parameters were calculated: \u0394H = H-H, \u0394V = V-V, The ratio between \u0394H and \u0394V equals tangent \u03b1, Calculated \u03b1 = inverse tangent \u03b1 .The Mean Horizontal bony movements was 3.75 mm (SD 1.4 mm, range -6 to 15 mm). The Mean Vertical bony movements was 1.4 mm (SD 0.8 mm, range 0.5-2 mm). The Mean Measured Osteotomy slope angle was 82.2 (SD 7.4, range 75-91). The Calculated Mean Slope Angle based on the \u0394H/\u0394V ratio was 82.3 (SD 7.0, range 74-95).The slope of the osteotomy used for the genioplasty dictates the vertical change. The osteotomy slope angle was defined as the angle between the osteotomy and a line perpendicular to the occlusal plane. The measured angle was compared with the calculated angle deduced from the horizontal and vertical genial post-operative changes.

One site received topical hemocoagulase while other site did not receive it. Both the sites were chosen in the same patient and extraction was done at separate intervals. The biopsy was done on a random basis with the pathologist being blinded to the study. Clinical evaluation was done on days 7, 14 and 21. Biopsy was done either on days 7 or 14 for the case as well as for the control. A clinical as well as histological score was developed and the healing was assessed. Statistical analysis was done using Wilcoxon signed rank test and p value \u2264 0.05 was considered significant and z-score was also calculated.The clinical score did not show any statistical significance. The histological total score on day 14 and combined overall analysis of days 7 and 14 showed statistical significance. There was an increased incidence (n = 4) of osteoid formation in the hemocoagulase group on day 14.The application of hemocoagulase may improve and accelerates the process of wound healing in extraction sockets.

VCostochondral Graft as Interpositional material for TMJ Ankylosis in Children: A Clinical Study.
p2027
aVTMJ ankylosis is one of the most disruptive anomaly that affects the masticatory system. The inability to move the mandible has significant functional ramification, such as the inability to eat a normal diet. Additionally, speech is affected, making it difficult for some individuals to communicate and express themselves to others. As there are several biologic and anatomic similarities to the mandibular condyles, autogenous costochondral grafts have been considered to be the most acceptable tissue for temporomandibular joint reconstruction. In addition donor site complications are infrequent and regeneration of the rib usually occurs within a year post operatively in children.The aim of this study was to evaluate the function of costochondral grafts to replace the mandibular condyles and to assess the position, growth, overgrowth, function, success, failure and resorption of costochondral grafts.Ten TMJ ankylosis patients were operated in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at Institute of Dental Sciences, Bareilly. Out of the 10 cases 6 were male patients and 4 female patients in age group of \u226414 years; of which 8 patients were of unilateral TMJ ankylosis and 2 were of bilateral TMJ ankylosis. All ten patients underwent interpositional gap arthroplasty with reconstruction of the condyle by costochondral graft.All patients with costochondral grafts had improved mandibular symmetry and growth with adequate mouth opening.This study indicates that using costochondral grafts to reconstruct TMJ ankylosis in children provides a good result.

VRising from Plagiarising.
p2030
aVAmongst the various forms of scientific misconduct, plagiarism has become increasingly prevalent in today's scientific process. Plagiarism is copying another author's ideas or words and portraying them as your own. Inclusion of another source's contents without giving credit to the source results in this unethical practice. Text derived directly from a source must always be put under quotation marks. Decreased awareness about plagiarism and what exactly constitutes it results in unintentional plagiarism. Plagiarism can be that of the ideas in which the author projects others' ideas as his own. It can also be that of the text also known as word to word plagiarism. Mosaic plagiarism is another form. Various guidelines formulated by esteemed scientific bodies such as World Association of Medical Editors, Committee on publication Ethics have provided an insight to authors, editors, publishers and peer reviewers into the practice of ethical writing. By understanding the true essence of plagiarism and following strict guidelines, it is certainly possible to avoid plagiarism. Various softwares are available to detect plagiarism. These softwares have a wide database which is scanned to reveal any kind of malpractice. If detected, it can have grave consequences causing not only retraction of the article but also loss of dignity. Failure to detect plagiarism reflects negatively on a journal. Originality is the true essence of any research or scientific paper. Any violation of this fact is an unforgivable offence. Thus, this review article attempts to cover the meaning, types, risks and ways to avoid plagiarism.

aVSalivary gland tumours constitute about less than 4 % of all head and neck tumours. Pleomorphic adenoma, also called benign mixed tumour, is the most common tumour of the salivary glands. About 80-90 % of these tumours occur in the major salivary gland mainly parotid gland and 10 % of them occur in the minor salivary glands.Aim of this case report is to discuss the unique case of giant parotid pleomorphic adenomas arising in the deep lobe involving the parapharyngeal space and difficulty in respiration at sleep during nights repoted at this institute. The patient was undergoing treatment for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome when she reported at this institute for disturbed sleep. Diagnosis was based on computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging and cytology by means of fine needle aspiration biopsy.An exhaustive pre-operative diagnostic algorithm is mandatory before approaching such lesions involving parapharyngeal space. Fine needle aspiration biopsy is, in our opinion, mandatory to avoid histological surprises. The surgical approach varies according to the location of the tumour and should provide excellent visibility with wide surgical exposure to secure local neurovascular structures.

aVEntamoeba histolytica is the protozoan parasite agent of amebiasis, an infectious disease of the human intestine and liver. This parasite contact and kills human cells by an active process involving pathogenic factors. Cellular traffic and secretion activities are poorly characterized in E. histolytica. In this work, we took advantage of a wide proteomic analysis to search for principal components of the endomembrane system in E. histolytica. A total of 5683 peptides matching with 1531 proteins (FDR of 1%) were identified which corresponds to roughly 20% of the total amebic proteome. Bioinformatics investigations searching for domain homologies (Smart and InterProScan programs) and functional descriptions (KEGG and GO terms) allowed this data to be organized into distinct categories. This data represents the first in-depth proteomics analysis of subcellular compartments in E. histolytica and allows a detailed map of vesicle traffic components in an ancient single-cell organism that lacks a stereotypical ER and Golgi apparatus to be established. The data are related to [1].

aVThe first consensus report of the working party of the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) set up in 2004 on acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) was published in 2009. Due to the rapid advancements in the knowledge and available information, a consortium of members from countries across Asia Pacific, "APASL ACLF Research Consortium (AARC)," was formed in 2012. A large cohort of retrospective and prospective data of ACLF patients was collated and followed up in this data base. The current ACLF definition was reassessed based on the new AARC data base. These initiatives were concluded on a 2-day meeting in February 2014 at New Delhi and led to the development of the final AARC consensus. Only those statements which were based on the evidence and were unanimously recommended were accepted. These statements were circulated again to all the experts and subsequently presented at the annual conference of the APASL at Brisbane, on March 14, 2014. The suggestions from the delegates were analyzed by the expert panel, and the modifications in the consensus were made. The final consensus and guidelines document was prepared. After detailed deliberations and data analysis, the original proposed definition was found to withstand the test of time and identify a homogenous group of patients presenting with liver failure. Based on the AARC data, liver failure grading, and its impact on the "Golden therapeutic Window," extra-hepatic organ failure and development of sepsis were analyzed. New management options including the algorithms for the management of coagulation disorders, renal replacement therapy, sepsis, variceal bleed, antivirals, and criteria for liver transplantation for ACLF patients were proposed. The final consensus statements along with the relevant background information are presented here.

VLiver dialysis in acute-on-chronic liver failure: current and future perspectives.
p2045
aVPatients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) are known to have a very high mortality rate as the majority of these patients succumb to multiorgan failure. Liver transplant remains the only option for these patients; however, there are problems with its availability, cost and also the complications and side effects associated with immunosuppression. Unlike advanced decompensated liver disease, there is a potential for hepatic regeneration and recovery in patients with ACLF. A liver support system, cell or non-cell based, logically is likely to provide temporary functional support until the donor liver becomes available or the failing liver survives the onslaught of the acute insult and spontaneously regenerates. Understanding the pathogenesis of liver failure and regeneration is essential to define the needs for a support system. Removal of hepatotoxic metabolites and inhibitors of hepatic regeneration by liver dialysis, a non-cell-based hepatic support, could help to provide a suitable microenvironment and support the failing liver. The current systems, i.e., MARS and Prometheus, have failed to show survival benefits in patients with ACLF based on which newer devices with improved functionality are currently under development. However, larger randomized trials are needed to prove whether these devices can enable restoration of the complex dysregulated immune system and impact organ failure and mortality in these patients.

aVThe primary factor causing recession is the morphology and anatomy of the dentition. The facial bony plate overlying the root is usually very thin. The complete absence of bone over the facial root surface is referred to as dehiscence. Such buccal bone defects in case of implant dentistry threaten the survival of dental implant. Many surgical techniques are introduced to enhance alveolar bone volume for placing the dental implants. Guided bone regeneration (GBR) is one such established surgical technique for correcting buccal dehiscence defects, along with the use of various barrier membranes for the same. This case report describes an implant placement in the maxillary left lateral incisor region showing dehiscence on the labial cortical plate, along with bone graft and GTR membrane.

VStress Distribution Around Single Short Dental Implants: A Finite Element Study.
p2051
aVBone height restrictions are more common in the posterior regions of the mandible, because of either bone resorption resulting from tooth loss or even anatomic limitations, such as the position of the inferior alveolar nerve. In situations where adequate bone height is not available in the posterior mandible region, smaller lengths of implants may have to be used but it has been reported that the use of long implants (length \u226510 mm) is a positive factor in osseointegration and authors have reported failures with short implants. Hence knowledge about the stress generated on the bone with different lengths of implants needs scientific evaluation. The purpose of this study was to compare and evaluate the influence of different lengths of implants on stress upon bone in mandibular posterior area. A 3 D finite element model was made of the posterior mandible using the details from a CT scan, using computer software (ANSYS 12). Four simulated implants with lengths 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm and 13 mm were placed in the centre of the bone. A static vertical force of 250 N and a static horizontal force of 100 N were applied. The stress generated in the cortical and cancellous bone around the implant were recorded and evaluated with the help of ANSYS. In this study, Von Mises stress on a 6 mm implant under a static vertical load of 250 N appeared to be almost in the same range of 8 and 10 mm implant which were more as compared to 13 mm implant. Von Mises stress on a 6mm implant under a static horizontal load of 100 N appeared to be less when compared to 8, 10 and 13 mm implants. From the results obtained it may be inferred that under static horizontal loading conditions, shorter implants receive lesser load and thus may tend to transfer more stresses to the surrounding bone. While under static vertical loading the shorter implants bear more loads and comparatively transmit lesser load to the surrounding bone.

aVProsthesis refers to artificial replacement of an absent part of the human body. These prostheses help in psychological support of the patients and enhance their social acceptance. Complete or partial finger amputations are some of most frequently encountered forms of partial hand loss. Micro vascular reconstruction is the first choice of rehabilitation but when it is contraindicated, unavailable, unsuccessful or unaffordable, the prosthetic rehabilitation is an alternative for improving the psychological status of an individual. Most of these artificial prostheses make use of silicone. The present paper tries to combine aesthetics with function. The authors have created functionally active finger prosthesis with the help of electromechanical controls. The prosthesis is battery-powered, light-weight, and allows the user to regain complete control of flexion and extension movements of an artificial finger.

aVIn the recent years esthetic dentistry has been the area of focus amongst the public. Esthetics is an important dimension in dental practice and the upcoming dentists need to be enabled to demonstrate their competencies for an efficient clinical outcome. The purpose of this study was to institute a cultural change within traditional didactic dental education towards student centred learning to cope up with the accelerating pace of medical technological change and achieving positive impact on patient care and patient satisfaction. Intervention that was considered for the project included David Merrill's first principles of instruction. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with all the students from four cohorts of final year dental undergraduate students, divided into an intervention group (n = 40) and a control group (n = 40). A professional assessment questionnaire is used to evaluate the relationship between the students and professional's assessment of esthetic treatment needs. The results of the study indicated that the ranking of the most and least noticeable dental features differed significantly (p = 0.0061) between the intervention and non intervention group and the indicates the intervention group to be in better agreement with professional assessment than the non intervention group of students with z value of 2.7435. The relative agreement between intervention group of undergraduate students and the professional assessment of esthetic treatment need shows the importance of intervention of Merrill's first principles of instruction in learning, emphasising the significance of PBL and therefore indicating a positive impact on successful esthetic treatment for patients.

VManagement of spastic cerebral palsy through multiple Ayurveda treatment modalities.
p2063
aVCerebral palsy (CP) is a leading cause of childhood disability affecting function and development. The global incidence of CP is 2:1000. It has been reported that children with CP and their caretaker have impaired health-related quality of life (QOL). Of the many types and subtypes of CP, none has any known cure. For a detailed description of the disease CP, though, there is no one to one correlation in Ayurvedic classics; it can be taken as Vata Vyadhi as far as its etiology and symptomatology are concerned.To assess the effect of certain Panchakarma procedures in the management of CP.Total 8 patients were registered and treated with 5 days of Udvartana, 5 days of Abhyanga followed by Sarvanga Swedana and then 8 days of Yoga Basti. The same course of treatment has been repeated for 3 times with an interval of 14 days. Ashtanga Ghrita was given during whole procedures as internal medication. Results of treatment were assessed with anthropometrical measurement, developmental milestone, Modified Ashworth Scale, spasm scale, reflex scale, and muscle power grading.This Ayurvedic management shows good result in CP patients, especially by improving growth (height, weight, chest circumference) and development (head holding and sitting), reducing spasticity of left upper limb and muscle spasm.Multisystem approach is needed to improve the condition of the patient. Panchakarma along with internal medication should be given to improve all the facets of spastic CP. Yoga Basti acts by their own mode of action and can be used freely for such disease conditions.

VEvaluation of analgesic activity of Terminalia arjuna (Roxb.) Wight and Arn bark: A tribal claim.
p2066
aVPlants occupy an important place in folk medicine all over the world for centuries and indigenous communities have developed their own specific knowledge on plant resources, uses, management, and conservation. Research interest and activities in the area of ethno medicine have increased tremendously in the last decade. Currently, scientists are evincing keen interest in the scientific evaluation of ethno medical claims. Bark powder of Arjuna (Terminalia arjuna [Roxb.] Wight and Arn) is used by tribals for the management of some painful conditions.To evaluate analgesic activity of T. arjuna bark in rodents.For evaluation of analgesic activity, different experimental models, that is, the acetic acid-induced writhing syndrome in mice, formaldehyde-induced paw licking response and tail flick test in rats were designed. Experiments were carried out at two-dose levels, that is, therapeutically equivalent dose (TED) and TED × 2. Animals were divided into three groups (six animals in each group), first group serving as a control group, second and third group labeled as test drug group.Test drug at both the doses significantly decreased the writhing syndrome in comparison to control the group. In comparison to control the group, incidences of formalin-induced paw licking were reduced in test drug groups in both early and late phases of pain. In tail flick response, threshold was significantly increased in both test drug groups at every time intervals.Study showed that stem bark of T. arjuna possesses analgesic activity in all experimental models.

Starches (Satwa) obtained from the rhizomes of two plants namely, Curcuma angustifolia Roxb. (Fam. Zingiberaceae) and Maranta arundinacea Linn. (Fam. Marantaceae) are used in folklore practice, as Tugaksheeree, for the treatment of the above-mentioned complaints.To assess the acute toxicity potential of the C. angustifolia and M. arundinacea along with their assessment for adaptogenic activity, by noting their effect on forced swimming-induced hypothermia and gastric ulceration in rats.For acute toxicity study, the effect of test drugs C. angustifolia and M. arundinacea rhizome starch were studied after a single administration of up to three dose levels, with 4400 mg/kg as the maximum dose. The animals were observed for 72 hours periodically and mortality was recorded up to seven days. The adaptogenic and anti-ulcer activities were assessed by determining and comparing the changes in rectal temperature, ponderal changes, ulcer index and histopathological parameters in the test drug group with that of stress control group.Both the drugs did not produce any toxic symptoms or mortality even up to the maximum dose level of 4400 mg/kg. Both the test drugs significantly reversed the stress-induced gastric ulceration in comparison to stress-control rats. Starch from rhizome of C. angustifolia reversed forced swimming-induced hypothermia apparently, but not to a significant extent. However, the reversal of hypothermia found statistically significant in the rhizome starch of the M. arundinacea treated group.M. arundinacea had better anti-stress activity in comparision to C. angustifolia.

aVOpuntia elatior Mill. (Nagaphani) fruits are traditionally recommended as an expectorant, remedy for whooping cough, asthma, gonorrhea, ulcers, tumors, in the treatment of diarrhea and syphilis. Many of these diseases are allied with oxidative stress caused by free radicals. Thus, current research is directed towards finding naturally-occurring antioxidants of plant origin.To evaluate antioxidant potential of hydro-alcoholic extract of the O. elatior fruits (HAOE) and its fractions.Using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and nitric oxide radical scavenging assay, total polyphenolic, flavonoid (FA), flavanone (FO) contents and degree of polymerization in relation with its antioxidant activity were examined.The experimental data indicated that the HAOE, ethyl acetate (EAOE) and butanol (BFOE) soluble fractions have shown significant antioxidant activity. The highest polyphenolic, FA, FO contents and degree of polymerization were found in EAOE. The scavenging potential was in the order of Ascorbic Acid > EAOE > BFOE > HAOE > BIOE, where ascorbic acid was used as a positive control. The increased antioxidant potential of EAOE and BFOE fractions over HAOE extract may be attributed to the purification achieved by fractionation of the extract which in turn resulted in an increase in the degree of polymerization and segregation of secondary metabolites.The fruit of O. elatior can be used as the best alternative for synthetic antioxidants.

aVClerodendrum infortunatum L. commonly known as Bhant plays a significant role in Indian System of Medicine, that is, Ayurveda, due to its medicinal properties. It grows easily in waste places of all areas of India, Bangladesh, and Myanmar.The present study was carried out with a view to lay down its pharmacognostic standards along with high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) studies in order to document/validate its therapeutic benefits.In this research, leaves of C. infortunatum were subjected to pharmacognostic evaluation parameters such as macroscopy, quantitative microscopy, physicochemical studies, phytochemical screening. HPTLC has been developed for detection and quantification of gallic acid and tyrosine in C. infortunatum. Increasing serial dilutions of reference standard gallic acid (20-100 \u03bcg/mL) and tyrosine (20-100 \u03bcg/mL) were scanned at 254 nm and 280 nm, respectively.Microscopy of leaf revealed the presence of anisocytic stomata, sclereids, glandular and covering trichome, and prisms of calcium oxalate crystal. The total ash, water-soluble, and acid insoluble ash values of leaves were 9.95%, 2.15%, and 0.70%, respectively. The maximum extractive value of crude powder was in the water. HPTLC studies revealed that the amount of gallic acid in the crude powder of test sample were high (0.244 mg/g) in comparison to tyrosine (0.081 mg/g).The data generated would be of significant use for the authentication of drug and would also serve as a reference for the standardization and quality control of C. infortunatum.

Hence, alternative systems of medicine are also being explored. Prameha as described in Ayurveda is a disease synonymous with today's DM. The patients of Prameha inherently carry the risk of impaired Agni and depleted Ojas status, that is, hypometabolic and immuno-compromised state. Now the primary goal is not merely to achieve normoglycemia, but also to minimize its complications. In this context, many Ayurvedic drugs are undergoing extensive research.To evaluate the anti-diabetic, immune-enhancer and biofire balancing effects of Naimittika Rasayana drugs viz. Silajatu and Mamajjaka in type-2 DM.A total of 95 patients of type-2 DM were registered; in which 84 patients turned up for full follow-up. Patients were randomly allocated into three groups; Group-A was treated with Mamajjaka (500mg twice a day) and Group-B with Silajatu (500mg twice a day) and Group-C was treated with modern drug and assessment was done at monthly intervals for three months.The selected Rasayana drugs have shown good response on subjective and objective parameters. The Mamajjaka treated patients responded better. However, as regards the reduction of post prandial blood sugar, Silajatu was superior.The Ayurveda-inspired holistic approach seems to have a unique response promoting Agni (biofire) and Ojas (immune strength) status leading to good health and wellness.

Most commonly Vrana can be classified into Shuddha and Dushta Vrana (chronic wound/nonhealing ulcers). Among the various drugs mentioned for Dushta Vrana, two of them, Neem (Azadirechta indica A. Juss) oil and Haridra (Curcuma longa Linn.) powder are selected for their wide spectrum action on wound.To compare the effect of Neem oil and Haridra in the treatment of chronic non-healing wounds.Total 60 patients of wounds with more than 6 weeks duration were enrolled and alternatively allocated to Group I (topical application of Neem oil), Group II (Haridra powder capsules, 1 g 3 times orally) and Group III (both drugs). Duration of treatment was considered until complete healing of the wound, whereas 4(th) and 8(th) week were considered for assessment of 50% healing. Wound size was measured and recorded at weekly intervals. Wound biopsy was repeated after 4 weeks for assessment of angiogenesis and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis.After 8 weeks of treatment, 50% wound healing was observed in 43.80% patients of Group I, 18.20% patients of Group II, and 70.00% patients of Group III. Microscopic angiogenesis grading system scores and DNA concentration showed highly significant effect of combined use of both drugs when compared before and after results of treatment (P < 0.001).Topical use of Neem oil and oral use of Haridra powder capsule used in combination were found effective for chronic non-healing wounds.

The diagnosis of DN is microalbuminuria is a powerful screening tool in screening DN earlier stages. A diabetic can develop nondiabetic renal disease like anyone, but the finding of diabetic retinopathy strongly suggests that any proteinuria is due to diabetic glomerulosclerosis. In this dissertation, all diabetic patients who showed positive diabetic retinopathy changes; were screened for 24 h microalbuminuria, at its earlier asymptomatic period itself. This research work is specially intended to instigate effective therapies at earlier stage itself, thereby prevent further progression.To evaluate the combined effect of Shilajitvadi Vataka, Punarnavadi Mandura, Triphala Guggulu and Pippalimooladi Paneeya added with Amrita and Bringaraja in DN.Single blind clinical study with pre-test and post-test was designed.

Though these four principles are influenced by the western world; in the medical field they are adapted as universal ethics. Originally, Ayurveda, the Indian medical system, has strongly advocated ethical code of conduct for physicians, but does not get its due recognition till this date. Proposed article aims to compare universally accepted basic tenets of bioethics and ancient Ayurvedic ethics. For this purpose classical texts of Ayurveda and literature regarding principlism was collected and analyzed thoroughly. It was found that the essence of ethics is very well-defined and described in the fundamental texts of Ayurveda in the form of Sadvritta, Chatushpada, Yogya, Vaidyavritti and Aachara Rasayana. Hence, Ayurveda should be considered as a trailblazer in establishing the basic tenets of bioethics.

aVAdministration of processed gold in children is a unique practice mentioned in Ayurveda as "Swarnaprashana" by Acharya Kashyapa thousands of years back. He explained evidently the administration of Swarna (gold) in children for the benefits of improving intellect, digestion and metabolism, physical strength, immunity, complexion, fertility, and life span. There are various formulations of gold and even along with herbal drugs explained by different Acharya for prolonged usage in children. Swarnaprashana in children can be mainly implicated in two contexts of Ayurveda; Lehana (supplementary feeds) and Jatakarma Samskara (newborn care). This review is an effort to critically evaluate the available data, which may be helpful in clearing some of the existing fallacies on the topic. The age and method of administration, benefits and dosage as per various classical textbooks of Ayurveda are discussed here along with the reports of related scientific studies. This review proposes that the benefits of Swarnaprashana can be achieved at multiple levels like as a general health promoter and in specific to enhancement of intelligence, digestion, metabolism, immunity, physical strength, complexion, or fertility. Ayurveda recommends only purified and processed form of gold for internal administration. The age at which Swarnaprashana should be administered and its duration can be determined depending upon the desired effect in children as a positive health care program.

The description of Dhatusarata (tissue excellence) has been given under Dashavidha Pariksha (tenfold examination) in Charak Samhita, Viman Sthana, 8(th) chapter. Some qualities, which are mentioned in Dhatusarata are difficult to assess, e.g. Sukha, Aishwarya, Upabhoga, Bala, etc., There is a need to develop some quantitative parameters to measure these qualities according to tissue excellence i.e. Dhatusarata. By assessing Dhatu Sarata, one can judge the true strength of a particular Dhatu but only the ability or strength is not enough to get success; the liking or interest is also essential to achieve success. The purpose of this study is to elaborate the concept of Dhatusarata and reveal different aspects of Sukha according to the quality of that particular Dhatu in context of vocational guidance. It will help to establish interrelationship between Dhatusarata and vocational guidance. It will be assessed whether this Sukha quality is merely happiness or having different shades according to the excellence of Dhatus and whether this study is useful in guiding the person to choose appropriate profession, which will be according to his liking and ability. It has been concluded that shades of Sukha quality varies with particular Dhatusaras, which may be helpful in guiding a suitable profession to an individual which will be according to his ability and liking i.e. Sukha for intimate success.

VHigh Recovery of Functional Islets Stored at Low and Ultralow Temperatures.
p2121
aVPoor recovery of islets upon cryopreservation is the main hurdle in islet banking. Pancreatic islets have a poor antioxidative defense mechanism, and exposure of islets to low temperature leads to oxidative stress.We aimed to investigate whether known compounds such as metformin, \u03b3 aminobutyric acid (GABA), docosahexanoic acid (DHA), or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) alone or in combination are capable of reducing oxidative stress for better islet recovery upon storage at suboptimal temperatures.Islets isolated from mouse pancreas were stored at low temperature (4°C) for 15 days and at ultralow temperature (-196°C) for 30 days with or without additives. After revival from cold storage, islets were assessed by using three methods: (1) specificity by dithizone (DTZ), (2) viability by fluorescein diacetate/propidium iodide (FDA/PI) and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetra-zolium bromide (MTT) assay, and (3) functionality by glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). The oxidative status of the islets stored at suboptimal temperatures was determined by both intracellular free radical release (fluorometric analysis) and lipid peroxidation (enzymatic determination).Supplementation with additives led to an improvement in islet survival upon storage at suboptimal temperatures, without depletion of insulin secretory activity, which was comparable to that of controls. The additives acted as cryoprotectants and antioxidants as revealed by high recovery of viable islets and reduction in total reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malonidealdehyde (MDA), respectively.Our results demonstrate for the first time that supplementation with EPA, DHA, and metformin may lead to higher islet recovery from -196°C storage, enabling proper islet banking.

p2128
aVA novel, colloidal nanogold-based drug delivery system for phenytoin, a well-known anti-epileptic drug with an enhanced efflux via P-glycoprotein, has been proposed in this study. The vital physical properties that would aid in predicting the biological interaction of this system were profiled using various techniques such as UV-Vis, DLS, and TEM in corroboration with theoretical calculations. It was significant to note that the binding of phenytoin to colloidal nanogold was strongly pH-dependent with the optimum at pH 5.5 and a consistently reproducible spectral shift. Analysis of the conjugate by FTIR revealed that the imide functional group of phenytoin mediated a dative coordinate bond to colloidal nanogold at the optimum pH. The amount of the drug bound to the gold was quantified to be 85.8±2.5% (w/v) by HPLC. Hypothetically, the surface charge of the conjugate could possibly imply charge-mediated uptake across the cell membrane. Further, the novel conjugate was screened for its cytotoxicity in two cell lines and the dosage range was identified. Subsequent development, thorough evaluations in suitable model systems, and the potential for bioimaging to track the payload would validate our hypothesis on the conjugate for better intracellular retention at the site of action, and thereby achieve the targeted delivery.

VNovel Stability-Indicating RP-HPLC Method for the Simultaneous Estimation of Clindamycin Phosphate and Adapalene along with Preservatives in Topical Gel Formulations.
p2131
aVA novel stability-indicating RP-HPLC method was developed for the simultaneous estimation of clindamycin phosphate (hydrophilic), adapalene (hydro-phobic), phenoxyethanol, and methylparaben in topical gel formulations. Optimum chromatographic separation among the analytes and stress-induced degradants peaks was achieved on the XBridge C18 (50 × 4.6 mm, 3.5 µm) column using a mobile phase consisting of a variable mixture of pH 2.50 ammonium hydrogen phosphate buffer, acetonitrile, and tetrahydrofuran with gradient elution. Detection was performed at 210 nm for phenoxyethanol, methylparaben, and clindamycin phosphate and 321 nm for adapalene. The method was optimized with a unique diluent selection for the extraction of clindamycin phosphate and adapalene from the gel matrix. The developed method was validated for method precision, specificity, LOD and LOQ, linearity, accuracy, robustness, and solution stability as per ICH guidelines. The proposed method can be employed for the quantification of clindamycin phosphate, adapalene, phenoxyethanol, and methylparaben in commercial topical gel formulations.

VStability-Indicating High-Performance Liquid Chromatographic Determination of Apixaban in the Presence of Degradation Products.
p2134
aVA simple, robust, and stability-indicating reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the analysis of apixaban and its related substances has been successfully developed. Chromatography was performed on a 250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm C18 column with a gradient mixture of a phosphate buffer-methanol 60:40 (v/v) at 1.0 mL min(-1). Ultraviolet detection of apixaban was at 220 nm. The method was validated for linearity, precision, repeatability, sensitivity, and selectivity. Selectivity was validated by subjecting apixaban solution to photolytic, acidic, basic, oxidative, and thermal degradation. The peaks from the degradation products did not interfere with that from apixaban. The method was used to quantify the related substances in apixaban in the bulk drug and can be used for routine quality control purposes.

p2139
aVThe objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence, types and severity of burn injuries, including sites involved, morbidities, operative procedures, and their outcomes, to prevent or reduce the frequency and morbidity of such injuries in epileptic patients. This retrospective study was conducted at our centre between February 2008 and January 2012. The study included 54 patients who sustained burn injuries due to epileptic seizures, accounting for 1.3% of all burn admissions. All patients, irrespective of the severity of their injuries, were admitted to our centre, assessed, treated and educated regarding specific preventive measures. All study data were evaluated from patient medical records. Causes of burn injury were as follows: scald burns (30), contact with hot surfaces (12), electrical burns in the bathroom (6), and flame burns (6). Second degree burns were the most common (18 out of 54 patients) and third degree burns were the least common. Upper limb and trunk were the most common sites involved (36 out of 54 patients). Thirty patients required surgical intervention whereas the remainder was conservatively managed. Most of the injuries occurred in the age group between 30-37 years. Injuries occurred predominantly in females [42 females, 12 males; F:M=3.5:1]. The study revealed that patients with epilepsy should be categorized as a high risk group considering the sudden and unpredictable attack of epileptic seizures leading to loss of consciousness and accidental burn injuries. Early surgical intervention and targeting of all epileptic patients for education and instituting the specific preventive measures gives good outcomes.L\u2019objectif de cette étude était d\u2019évaluer l\u2019incidence, le type et la gravité des brûlures, y compris les organes impliqués, les morbidités, les chirurgies, et les résultats des chirurgies, et de prévenir ou de réduire la fréquence et la morbidité de ces blessures chez les patients épileptiques.

p2153
aVThe present study was aimed to investigate the effects of addition of modified potato starch on the biochemical and textural properties of shrimp analogue/imitation shrimp, a popular value-added product prepared from surimi. Three batches of shrimp analogues were prepared with 0 % (NPS), 50 % (CPS) and 100 % (MPS) of modified starch incorporation and various quality attributes were monitored at regular intervals during frozen storage (-20 °C). Loss of myofibrillar protein was least for the shrimp analogue sample added with 100 % modified potato starch. The expressible moisture content of MPS (2.48 %) was less affected by long term storage compared to CPS (3.38 %) and NPS (3.99 %). During extended low temperature storage, the textural quality of sea food analogue was highly influenced by the type of starch added to it. The percentage of modified potato starch added to shrimp analogue significantly (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05) affected its hardness and fracturability. MPS samples did not show significant changes in hardness during storage as compared to other two samples. Springiness of shrimp analogue increased 2.57, 1.5 and 1.77 times with the storage period for samples with NPS, CPS and MPS, respectively. Addition of modified potato starch improved the sensory quality and textural properties of shrimp analogue and reduced the quality degradation during frozen storage as compared to NPS which contained only native potato starch.

aVGluten free biscuits, also suitable during fasting were developed utilizing different levels of fruits (water chestnut and makhana) and starchy vegetable (potato) powders. Biscuits were developed using creamery method and evaluated for physical properties, proximate composition, sensory characteristics and storability for 90 days at room temperature. Expansion in diameter of biscuits with different level of potato and makhana powder varied between 1.026 to 1.059 and 1.046 to 1.059, respectively as compared to 1.075 for biscuits prepared using water chestnut only. Breaking hardness and toughness of different biscuit was increased with increasing level of potato or makhana powder in flour blends and higher in potato powder incorporated biscuits. Whiteness (L values) of biscuits was decreased with increasing level of potato powder while a reverse trend was observed in case of makhana powder incorporated biscuits. Protein content in biscuits with makhana powder was higher than the biscuits prepared using potato powder in flour blends. Biscuits prepared using hundred percent water chestnut showed the maximum crude fibre content in them. Results indicated that gluten free biscuits for fasting people can be prepared using potato powder or makhana powder up to 50 % with water chestnut powder. The overall sensory acceptability of biscuits with makhana powder was better than for biscuits with potato powder with maximum overall acceptability scores for biscuits developed using 70:30 parts of water chestnut and makhana powders in flour blend, which were storable for 90 days period at room temperature.

p2159
aVMAP is a dynamic system where respiration of the packaged product and gas permeation through the packaging film takes place simultaneously. The desired level of O2 and CO2 in a package is achieved by matching film permeation rates for O2 and CO2 with respiration rate of the packaged product. A mathematical model for MAP of fresh fruits applying enzyme kinetics based respiration equation coupled with the Arrhenious type model was developed. The model was solved numerically using MATLAB programme. The model was used to determine the time to reach to the equilibrium concentration inside the MA package and the level of O2 and CO2 concentration at equilibrium state. The developed model for prediction of equilibrium O2 and CO2 concentration was validated using experimental data for MA packaging of apple, guava and litchi.

p2162
aVThe objective of the present study was to develop a stable flaxseed oil emulsion for the delivery of omega-3 (\u03c9-3) fatty acids through food fortification. Oil-in-water emulsions containing 12.5 % flaxseed oil, 10 % lactose and whey protein concentrate (WPC)-80 ranging from 5 to 12.5 % were prepared at 1,500, 3,000 and 4,500 psi homogenization pressure. Flaxseed oil emulsions were studied for its physical stability, oxidative stability (peroxide value), particle size distribution, zeta (\u03b6)-potential and rheological properties. Emulsions homogenized at 1,500 and 4,500 psi pressure showed oil separation and curdling of WPC, respectively, during preparation or storage. All the combinations of emulsions (homogenized at 3,000 psi) were physically stable for 28 days at 4-7\u2009ºC temperature and did not show separation of phases. Emulsion with 7.5 % WPC showed the narrowest particle size distribution (190 to 615 nm) and maximum zeta (\u03b6)-potential (-33.5 mV). There was a slight increase in peroxide value (~20.98 %) of all the emulsions (except 5 % WPC emulsion), as compared to that of free flaxseed oil (~44.26 %) after 4 weeks of storage. Emulsions showed flow behavior index (n) in the range of 0.206 to 0.591, indicating higher shear thinning behavior, which is a characteristic of food emulsions. Results indicated that the most stable emulsion of flaxseed oil (12.5 %) can be formulated with 7.5 % WPC-80 and 10 % lactose (filler), homogenized at 3,000 psi pressure. The formulated emulsion can be used as potential omega-3 (\u03c9-3) fatty acids delivery system in developing functional foods such as pastry, ice-creams, curd, milk, yogurt, cakes, etc.

VPrimary prevention with statins in cardiovascular diseases: A Saudi Arabian perspective.
p2168
aVCardiovascular disease (CVD) constitutes one of the major causes of deaths and disabilities, globally claiming 17.3 million lives a year. Incidence of CVD is expected to rise to 25 million by 2030, and Saudi Arabia, already witnessing a rapid rise in CVDs, is no exception. Statins are the drugs of choice in established CVDs. In the recent past, evidence was increasingly suggesting benefits in primary prevention. But over the last decade Saudi Arabia has a witnessed significant rise in CVD-related deaths. Smoking, high-fat, low-fiber dietary intake, lack of exercise, sedentary life, high blood cholesterol and glucose levels were reported as frequent CVD-risk factors among Saudis, who may therefore be considered for primary prevention with statin. The prevalence of dyslipidemia, in particular, indicates that treatment should be directed at reducing the disorder with lipid-modifying agents and therapeutic lifestyle changes. The recent American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines has reported lowering the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target levels, prescribed by the 2011 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS). The new ACC/AHA guidelines have overemphasized the use of statin while ignoring lipid targets, and have recommended primary prevention with moderate-intensity statin to individuals with diabetes aged 40-75 years and with LDL-C 70-189 mg/dL. Treatment with statin was based on estimated 10-year atherosclerotic-CVD (ASCVD) risk in individuals aged 40-75 years with LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL and without clinical ASCVD or diabetes. Adoption of the recent ACC/AHA guidelines will lead to inclusion of a large population for primary prevention with statins, and would cause over treatment to some who actually would not need statin therapy but instead should have been recommended lifestyle modifications. Furthermore, adoption of this guideline may potentially increase the incidences of statin intolerance and side-effects. On the other hand, the most widely used lipid management guideline, the 2011 ESC/EAC guidelines, targets lipid levels at different stages of disease activity before recommending statins. Hence, the 2011 ESC/EAC still offers a holistic and pragmatic approach to treating lipid abnormalities in CVD. Therefore, it is the 2011 ESC/EAC guidelines, and not the recent ACC/AHA guidelines, that should be adopted to draw guidance on primary prevention of CVD in Saudi Arabia.

VNarrow-band imaging and white-light endoscopy with optical magnification in the diagnosis of dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus: results of the Asia-Pacific Barrett's Consortium.
p2171
aVThe advent and utility of new endoscopic imaging modalities for predicting the histology of Barrett's esophagus (BE) in real time with high accuracy appear promising and could potentially obviate the need to perform random biopsies where guidelines are poorly adhered to. We embarked on evaluating the performance characteristics of white-light endoscopy with magnification (WLE-z), narrow-band imaging with magnification (NBI-z) and a combination of both modalities.This was a prospective online study with 28 endoscopists from 11 countries (Asia-Pacific region) participating as assessors. In total, 35 patients with BE were assessed using 150 slides from WLE-z and NBI-z randomly arranged using a simple classification with corresponding histology. The overall Accuracy (Acc), Sensitivity (Sn), Specificity (Sp), Positive Predictive Value (PPV), and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of WLE-z, NBI-z and a combination of both were calculated.The overall Acc for WLE-z and NBI-z images was 87.1\u200a% and 88.7\u200a%, respectively. When images from the two modalities were placed side by side, the Acc increased to 90.3\u200a%. The Sn, Sp, PPV, and NPV of WLE-z were 48\u200a%, 92\u200a%, 45\u200a%, and 93\u200a% while with NBI-z, these improved to 89\u200a%, 89\u200a%, 56\u200a%, and 98\u200a%, respectively. When both imaging modalities were viewed together, they improved further to 93\u200a%, 90\u200a%, 61\u200a%, and 99\u200a%.The high NPV (99\u200a%) when both WLE-z and NBI-z were used simultaneously indicates that areas with regular appearance that are diagnosed with confidence can effectively be left alone and not biopsied when performed at a skilled resourced center. This approach could potentially lead to a paradigm shift of how patients with BE are assessed.

VIron induced genotoxicity: attenuation by vitamin C and its optimization.
p2174
aVVitamin C (VC) is a well-known antioxidant and strong free radical scavenger. Its antioxidant activity is useful for protection of cellular macromolecules, particularly DNA, from oxidative damage induced by different agents. This study was undertaken to evaluate the optimum level of VC in attenuating the chromosome aberrations (CAs) and DNA damage after iron sulfate (FeSO4) acute administration in Wistar rats. The results exhibited that the increase of CAs and DNA damage induced by FeSO4, 200 mg Fe/kg, could be reduced significantly by VC pretreatment at the dose of 500 mg/kg (p<0.001), but not in the 100 mg/kg group. The findings provide evidence that VC at the dose of 500 mg/kg exerted a possible protective effect against FeSO4 induced CAs and DNA damage. The possible mechanisms of VC may be attributed to its property as a free radical scavenger or to its indirect action in reducing the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Some viruses like herpes simplex, herpes zoster, adenovirus, enterovirus 70, influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and cytomegalovirus are well-known for their role in ocular pathology. In recent years, emerging and resurging viral infections represent an important public health problem. The Asia-Pacific region has witnessed a number of pandemic and epidemic outbreaks caused by these viruses during the last 2 decades. The number of ocular complications being reported in patients of these viral infections has also increased significantly during this period. Ophthalmologists and physicians should be aware of ocular manifestations of newly emerging or resurging viral diseases. We conducted a review of the literature published during the last 20 years with the objectives of finding out outbreaks of emerging and reemerging viruses in the Asia-Pacific region and finding out any ocular involvement in these viral infections. An iterative search of the MEDLINE and the Google databases was made using the search terms emerging virus, ocular manifestations, ocular complications, Chikungunya, Dengue, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile fever, Kyasanur forest disease, Rift valley fever, Hantavirus, Henipavirus, Influenza virus, Enterovirus 71, and Asia-Pacific region, separately and with reported ocular involvement in combination.

The patients underwent standard diagnostic microbiological evaluation, and their treatment was guided by microbiology results and clinical response to therapy. Data were analyzed for the incidence, predisposing factors, clinical picture, microbiology, and the treatment outcome.Fifteen patients of microbial keratitis showed Aeromonas species to be the causative agent, constituting 0.5% of bacterial keratitis diagnosed during this period. Laboratory results showed that Aeromonas hydrophila was the predominant species isolated. Most of the isolates were susceptible to commonly used ocular antibiotics. Medical therapy resulted in resolution of infection in 9 (60%) of 15 cases. Five patients required application of cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive with bandage contact lens for corneal perforation. Two of the 5 patients needed penetrating keratoplasty for uncontrolled infection. Twelve of 15 patients had some local predisposing host factors for the infection.Aeromonas species are uncommon but important causal agents of microbial keratitis. The organisms most often cause infection in individuals with local predisposing factors. Aeromonas hydrophila is the predominant species associated with keratitis. Although the organisms are susceptible to most antibiotics, a third of the patients required additional surgical intervention.

aVDonor notification and counselling transforms the legal and ethical requirement of disclosure of transfusion transmissible infection (TTI) in a blood donor into practice. The present study was done to assess the response to the disclosure of TTI reactivity results in blood donors, assess the risk factors in blood donors and follow the compliance of the disclosure and clinical referral in a population of blood donors who are difficult to convince that they may be harbouring infections apparently in a healthy state today but with possible clinical disease consequences in the future. A retrospective study was conducted from April 2011 to November 2012. Screening was done using third generation ELISA kits used according to the manufacturer's directions; these kits were approved for use in blood banks by the Drug Controller General of India. Those testing repeat reactive were referred for further confirmation and management. The total number of TTI reactive donors was 787 (0.93 %, N = 83,865). The observed response rate in the present study is 21.6 % (167, N = 787). The risk factors for acquiring infections in TTI reactive donors were statistically significant history of high risk behaviour (20.3 %) for human immunodeficiency virus infection and history of jaundice in themselves, family or close contacts (16.1 %) for hepatitis B virus infection. One hundred and ten (65.8 %) of the referred donors were on outpatient clinical care when post-referral follow up was conducted. The study emphasises on continuing sensitization of blood donation camp organisers to the need of privacy during blood donor selection. The study also stresses the need to strengthen the pre-donation counselling at outdoor blood donation at the same time raise awareness amongst blood donors about the importance of post-donation counselling and follow up.

aVNeed for frequent blood transfusions exposes thalassemia major patients to risk of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs). Screening of donor blood through national protocols for possible infections like hepatitis B and C, HIV, syphilis and malaria is considered the optimal preventive method. There is constant need to explore the effect of currently used protocols of blood-donor screening by determining the burden of TTIs in multi-transfused patients. The current study was conducted to determine the burden of TTIs among multi-transfused Thalassemia patients registered at a Government hospital of central India. Sixty-six multi-transfused Thalassemia patients reporting during a period of eight months were screened for hepatitis B and C, HIV as well as syphilis by using standard diagnostic tests. Selected clinical, socio-demographic and other characteristics were also recorded to understand the determinants of risks of these infections. The sero-prevalence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV and syphilis was 3.0, 18.2, 1.5 and 0 % respectively amongst the patients. Vaccination against hepatitis B was found to be protective. Majority of the infected patients had history of transfusion from non government blood banks. There is a considerable burden of Hepatitis C among multi-transfused Thalassemia patients. The currently used screening tests need to be revalidated or replaced to prevent false-negative diagnoses. All sectors need to optimally implement and control both, the quality of blood donors and the mandatory screening of blood and blood products against the TTIs along with prospective longitudinal data and follow up of patients.

VRole of Interosseous Recurrent Artery Perforators in the Posterior Interosseous Artery Flap.
p2203
aVThe Posterior Interosseous Artery flap is a fasciocutaneous flap based on the Posterior Interosseous artery which lies invested by the fascial septum between the Extensor carpi ulnaris and Extensor Digiti Minimi where it gives off septocutaneous branches that spread out on the deep fascia to form longitudinal fascial arcades as well as supply the deep extensors. The conventional flap based on these perforators is restricted to the middle-thirds of the dorsum of forearm. Preservation of the perforators from the Interosseous Recurrent Artery by proximal ligation of the Interosseous Recurrent Artery and by protecting the index septum prolongation carrying the perforators of IRA can help us to recruit larger tissue in the flap. A total of 20 clinical cases and 10 cadaveric dissections were done to objectively define this technique.

VBilateral Florid Juvenile Fibroadenomas of the Breast in an Adolescent: A Rare Indication for Subcutaneous Mastectomy.
p2214
aVJuvenile fibroadenomas are rare and constitute about 0.5% to 4% of all fibroadenomas. They present as circumscribed, often large breast masses in adolescent females and are usually managed with simple enucleation.A 15-year-old girl presented with a 6-month history of rapidly growing breasts. On examination, she was found to have large, diffusely nodular breasts with marked asymmetry. Ultrasound and fine needle aspiration cytology results were suggestive of fibroadenomas, and the patient was planned for excision through a submammary incision.During surgery, both the breasts were found to be studded with nodules of varying sizes with very little normal breast tissue. A bilateral subcutaneous mastectomy was performed for complete removal of the fibroadenomas. Histopathology was reported as multiple juvenile fibroadenomas. Both breasts were later reconstructed with a latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap with implants. We present this case to highlight a rare indication for bilateral subcutaneous mastectomy for a benign condition of the breast.

VReconstruction of post-traumatic long segment bone defects of the lower end of the femur by free vascularized fibula combined with allograft (modified Capanna's technique).
p2217
aVSalvage of long segment bone loss in the limbs particularly near the joints continues to be a challenge to the trauma surgeon. None of the techniques available are universally successful and all share the disadvantages of multi-staged procedures. A reliable single-stage technique would be ideal to reduce the treatment time and the cost of care. We are presenting here our experience of successfully using the modified Capanna technique of combining allograft and free vascularized fibular graft in treating large bone defects in the distal third of the femur.Between April 2012 and October 2013, six patients with post-traumatic long segment bone loss in the distal femur had reconstruction of the bone defect by the Capanna technique. The average age was 33 years (range of 18-49 years). The bone defect ranged from 10 to 20 cm (average 15 cm). Five patients had primary reconstruction while one was done after allograft failure. Bone union time and occurrence of any complications were noted. Follow-up ranged from 7 to 24 months (average 15 months).All grafts went onto union. No patient required secondary procedure to achieve union. Average time to union was 6 months. One patient had deep infection and delayed union of distal end of the fibula graft.Free vascularized fibular graft combined with allograft increases initial stability, allows early weight bearing, has higher chances of union and is a good single-stage technique of reconstruction of distal third femur defects.

Students were divided into groups of three where one acted as a doctor, the second as a patient and the third as an observer. Students were asked to perform a role-play of a prepared clinical scenario where the patient had a hidden fear of malignancy. Observations were recorded in a simplified Calgary-Cambridge consultation checklist. Students' feedback and their emotions written after the role-play were analysed and discussed. Assessment of their learning was done with an objective structured clinical examination.Students' feedback revealed that they were sensitized to the importance of starting the consultation with an open question, listening to the opening statement, non-verbal.

SCL methodology also advocates active involvement of students in the curriculum planning, selection of teaching-learning methods and assessment process. We planned an education innovation project to assess the perception of fifth semester undergraduate medical students towards implementation of an SCL methodology.The study was done among 87 fifth semester undergraduate medical students (batch of 2010-11) in the noncommunicable disease epidemiology section of Community Medicine at the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry. The students divided themselves into seven groups and developed the learning objectives, selected teaching-learning methods and assessment process for each session. The facilitators had 3-5 rounds of interaction with each group before the session. Qualitative analysis of feedback collected from students and external faculty after each session was done. The effect of implementing the SCL methodology was assessed by the reaction level of Kirkpatrick's training evaluation model by using a rating scale Results. Of the 87 eligible students, 73 (83.9%) returned the forms for evaluation. All seven groups were able to formulate the learning objectives. Most of the groups had used PowerPoint slides and videos as a teaching-learning tool. Innovative assessment methods such as crosswords and 'chocopati' were used by some groups. In general, the perception of students was favourable towards SCL compared to conventional methods and they felt that this methodology should be adopted more often. Time management and organization of sessions were the main problems encountered by the students. The mean (SD) score for the items 'sessions were useful', 'sessions were enjoyable' and 'sessions improved my knowledge' were 6.2 (1.8), 7.1 (1.8) and 6.3 (1.9), respectively.The majority of students found the sessions on innovative teaching-learning and assessment techniques enjoyable, useful and informative. The sessions showed that students took an active part in curriculum planning, execution and evaluation.

VDetection of comorbid illnesses during pre-anaesthesia evaluation in a university teaching hospital: A prospective observational study.
p2242
aVConsultation for surgery and anaesthesia is often the first point of contact with a healthcare provider for a majority of patients in developing countries. In India, where patients have poor access to healthcare, they are likely to present with uncontrolled/untreated/undetected coexisting diseases. However, there is little published literature on this aspect. We hypothesized that many of our patients will present to our pre-anaesthesia evaluation clinic (PAC) with undetected comorbid illnesses and will require proper assessment, treatment and optimization before surgery. Thus, we aimed to assess the frequency and type of comorbid illnesses in patients attending the pre-anaesthesia clinic for elective surgery.We did a prospective observational study on all patients evaluated in the PAC of our university teaching hospital over a 3-month period to assess the frequency and type of comorbid illnesses. The data recorded included demographic profile and presence of coexisting illness and was classified as preexisting or newly diagnosed at the time of the visit to the PAC. The data were then tabulated and analysed statistically using SPSS software version 14.0. The frequency and percentage of occurrence for each comorbid illness was determined.Of 3973 patients, 242 (6%) had 304 comorbid illnesses (135 cardiac, 54 endocrine, 15 respiratory, 12 others). Of these 88 (29%) were newly detected comorbid conditions (69 cardiac, 9 endocrine, 9 respiratory, 1 others). The most frequent comorbid illness both pre-existing and newly diagnosed were cardiac. Hypertension was the commonest problem in our study population (168 patients).We confirmed that a PAC can detect hitherto undetected comorbid illnesses which are likely to impact the perioperative process.

aVTemporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis due to undiagnosed condylar fractures has a high incidence in India compared to western countries. We evaluated the demographics, injury pattern, hospital reporting and referral pattern of undiagnosed condylar fractures complicating TMJ ankylosis in northern India.We did a retrospective analysis by retrieving medical records of patients with post-traumatic TMJ ankylosis reporting to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, All India Institute of Medical Sciences between 1 July 2012 and 30 June 2013.Of 90 patients with post-traumatic TMJ ankylosis, 74 (82.2%) resided in rural areas. Sixty-three (70%) patients were from the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. Only 8.8% had higher education and 10% had an annual income of more than `2 lakh. In 69 (84.4%) patients, fall was the aetiological factor. Primary health centres (42%) and private clinics (20.5%) received the major share of patients immediately following injury. Few patients (19.3%) had some radiographic examination done and only 17% were referred by the primary healthcare provider. Of those referred only 3 were examined by a dental practitioner. Only 10% of all were diagnosed with condylar fractures.Patients with TMJ ankylosis presenting to us have poor literacy and income levels. A missed diagnosis of condylar fractures by rural healthcare providers contributes to its high incidence in India. Improving awareness of clinicians and improved rural healthcare infrastructure can help prevent this complication.

aVTuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem in India. Several studies carried out in India have shown alcoholism as a risk factor for tuberculosis mortality, factor for default in TB and reason for non-compliance under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP). The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence, pattern and associated factors of alcohol use among tuberculosis patients in Udupi taluk, Karnataka, India.A cross-sectional study was conducted with the complete enumeration of all the cases undergoing Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS) treatment in Primary Health Centre and Community Health Centre of Udupi taluk from March to April 2013. Interview was conducted to obtain the socio-demographic and health information and participants were screened using WHO developed Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) for alcohol use.Out of 123 participants, 78% were males, 86.2% were Hindu, 79.7% were married and 88.6% were from low socio-economic status. About 20.3% (n=25) participants were alcoholic. Among them, 44% were low risk drinkers, 32% were hazardous drinkers, 4% were harmful drinkers and 20% were alcohol dependent. Age, sex, occupation, tobacco use, perceived health status and discrimination due to tuberculosis positive status were significantly associated with alcohol use. On logistic regression sex, tobacco use, perceived health status and facing discrimination due infection with tuberculosis were found to be factors associated with alcohol use.This study found a high prevalence of alcoholism among tuberculosis patients which is of concern and has to be addressed.

aVOral colonization with Candida species has been observed in upto 93% of patients receiving radiation for head and neck cancer. With immunosuppression there is a trend of emergence of rare species. The present study aimed to assess species and colonization of candida at different stages of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.Oral rinses of thirty cancer patients receiving a six weeks course of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer were taken at two intervals; first at the start of radiation (0 Grays), and second at completion of radiation (60 Grays). The oral rinse was streaked onto a differential media (CHROMagar®) plates and incubated at 37ºC for 48 hours. Colony forming units (CFU) were counted and species were differentiated. Fifteen healthy controls were compared.The candida albicans colony count (CFU/ml) at baseline, 0 Grays radiation ranged from 50 to 1820 CFU/ml in cases and from 0 to 300 CFU/ml in controls. C. albicans was seen in all cases (100%) and most of the controls (86.66%). Other species such as C. Krusei, C. parapsilosis, C .tropicalis, and C. glabrata were observed with a frequency of 10%, 6.66%, 3.33%, and 3.33% respectively in the cases. However, no species other than C. albicans was observed in controls.Immunosupression of radiation therapy patients led to the development of species other than Candida albicans, which is the most prevalent species. Thus it can be inferred that there is emergence of the opportunistic fungal pathogens in patients with immunosupression.

VThe Local Effect of Alendronate with Intra-alveolar Collagen Sponges on Post Extraction Alveolar ridge Resorption: A Clinical Trial.
p2260
aVExtraction of teeth is followed by resorption of the residual alveolar ridge that continues throughout life resulting in loss of alveolar height and width. Of the numerous techniques that have been used to arrest post extraction alveoloar ridge resorption, the placement of a graft material inside the socket immediately after extraction has been mostly followed. Type 1 collagen is one of the commonly used graft material that prevent resorption by providing dimensional stability to the socket. Bisphosphonates are an anti-osteoclastic drug that prevent resorption by disrupting the membrane ruffling of the osteoclasts. Alendronate a bisphosphonate, is primarily used in diseases with bone loss. It has been used to reduce active bone resorption significantly without interfering with bone mineralization and quality. The need for the study is to examine the inhibitory effect of alendronate on residual ridge resorption when applied locally in combination with type I collagen on alveolar bone immediately following tooth extraction.Twenty patients with age between 30 and 65 years were selected from the out patient department of The Oxford Dental College and Hospital. The patients were divided into two groups. In the first group after extraction of teeth from premolar to midline the sockets were irrigated with saline and sutured. On the left side type I collagen sponge was placed and sutured. In the other group the right side was treated the same way after extraction as in first group where as in the left side sockets type I collagen soaked in 20 mg/ml of alendronate was placed and sutured. Patients were evaluated clinically for any local irritation as well as radiologically with orthopantomograph X-rays were taken immediately after the extraction, 1 month after extraction and 4 months after extraction to determine the amount of bone loss prevented.The statistically significant bone loss prevented by the collagen alone was 22.8 % and in collagen with alendronate group was 44.38 % at the end of 4 months.Type I collagen soaked with alendronate when placed in the socket immediately after extraction of teeth prevents post-extraction alveolar ridge resorption.

Analysing the fate of the graft by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images helps in excellent visualization of both bony and soft tissue anatomy of the operated TMJ joint as well as in assessing the changes in dermis graft which was previously placed.To investigate the radiological fate of the dermis-fat graft within the TMJ using MRI.Five joints of five patients who had dermis-fat grafts placed in their TMJ following gap arthroplasty were recruited for this study. Each patient had undergone TMJ gap arthroplasty with immediate dermis-fat graft placement. All the patients are then subjected to MRI.Fat graft was identified in close proximity to the mandibular condyle in all cases, with only three joints demonstrating fat covering the entire articular surface of the mandibular condyle. In the remaining joints the interpositional material found in the MRI defined joint space with mainly grey appearance, suggesting tissue change to other than fat, i.e. scar or granulation tissue.When free fat dermis graft is placed as interpositional material the graft occupied the entire TM joint and prevented it from recurrent ankylosis. The graft placed aids in normal functioning of the temperomandibular joint without any complications.

VTherapeutic interventions in oral submucous fibrosis: an experimental and clinical study.
p2266
aVOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic debilitating disease and premalignant condition of the oral cavity and is a serious public health issue in India and many parts of the world. The treatment is still elusive and empirical because of poorly understood etiopathogenesis, which is believed to be multifactorial including areca nut chewing, ingestion of chillies, genetic and immunologic processes, nutritional deficiencies, and many others. The present investigations was focused to understand the possible therapeutic interventions of anti-OSF agents in arecoline induced experimental in vitro model of OSF and clinical application of these anti-OSF agents in the restoration of various grade of the disease.The 127 subjects were selected from patients who visited the OPD of Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Faculty of Dental Sciences, K.G. Medical University, Lucknow. Further the subjects were divided in two groups on the basis of clinical examination. Group-1 subjects showed presence of fibrosis bands in the labial and/or buccal mucosa, loss of elasticity, difficulty to open the mouth and had a habit chewing areca-nut in some form. Group-2 subjects had no habit of chewing areca-nut, were apparently healthy with no mucosal disorder. The samples were collected and were immediately transported to Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Lucknow, for isolation and cultivation of primary cultures of mucosal fibroblast cells. Then isolation and cultivation of oral mucosal fibroblast, identification of non-cytotoxic doses of arecoline, real time PCR, immunocytochemistry, cytokine determination in culture cells, western blot analyses, functional activity of collagenase, lysyl oxidase enzyme activity, collagen beads assay, cyclooxygenase (COX-2) expression analysis was done.This study, shows that the reduction of phagocytic cells was strongly related to the arecoline levels in fibroblast culture when we exposed arecoline to normal oral mucosal cells (NOMC) and cells from OSF patient. An enhancement of phagocytic cells was observed following the pre exposure of cells to 1 \u03bcM dexamethasone, a glucocorticoids, In this study, histologic evidence is presented which supports the finding that COX-2 expression is upregulated in OSF specimens compared to normal oral submucosal cells. Strong immunostaining for COX-2 was detected in arecoline exposed NOMC and cells from OSF patient. Areca nut extract up-regulates prostaglandin production, cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA and protein expression of human oral keratinocytes. The number of phagocytic cells and phagocytic activity in cultured human oral fibroblasts from OSF site was lower than the fibroblasts from the normal regions of the same person.

VReview of methods for the detection and quantification of adulteration of rice: Basmati as a case study.
p2272
aVRice is a staple and widely grown crop endowed with rich genetic diversity. As it is difficult to differentiate seeds of various rice varieties based on visual observation accurately, the harvested seeds and subsequent processed products are highly prone to adulteration with look-alike and low quality seeds by the dishonest traders. To protect the interests of importing countries and consumers, several methods have been employed over the last few decades for unambiguous discrimination of cultivars, accurate quantification of the adulterants, and for determination of cultivated geographical area. With recent advances in biotechnology, DNA based techniques evolved rapidly and proved successful over conventional non-DNA based methods to purge the problem of adulteration at commercial level. In the current review, we made an attempt to summarize the existing methods of adulteration detection and quantification in a comprehensive manner by providing Basmati as a case study to enable the traders to arrive at a quick resolution in choosing the apt method to eliminate the adulteration practice in the global rice industry.

aVPropolis is a multicomponent active, complex resinous substance collected by honeybees (Apis mellifera) from a variety of plant sources. This study was designed to improve the antimicrobial efficacy of propolis by engineering a niosomal-based system for topical application.Propolis was extracted in ethanol and screened for total polyphenol content. Propolis-loaded niosomes (PLNs) were prepared with varying concentrations of Span 60 and cholesterol. The PLNs were evaluated for physicochemical parameters, namely, vesicle size, entrapment efficiency, zeta potential, surface topography and shape, and stability, followed by screening for in vitro antimicrobial activity. The PLNs were formulated into propolis niosomal gel (PNG) using Carbopol P934 base and subjected to ex vivo skin deposition study.The ethanolic extract of propolis had high polyphenolic content (270 ± 9.2 mg GAE/g). The prepared PLNs showed vesicle size between 294 nm and 427 nm, and the percent entrapment in the range of 50.62-71.29% with a significant enhancement in antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Enhanced antimicrobial activity of PLNs was attributed to the ability of niosomes to directly interact with the bacterial cell envelop thereby facilitating the diffusion of propolis constituents across the cell wall. The formulated PNG exhibited a twofold better skin deposition due to improved retention of niosomes in the skin.The findings indicate that the engineering of a niosomal-based system for propolis enhanced its antimicrobial potential through topical application.

VMangiferin induces cell death against rhabdomyosarcoma through sustained oxidative stress.
p2278
aVEmbryonic rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) is the most prevalent type of cancer among children. The present study aimed to investigate cell death induced by mangiferin in RD cells.The Inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of mangiferin was determined by an MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide) assay. Cell death induced by mangiferin against RD cells was determined through lactate dehydrogenase and nitric oxide release, intracellular calcium levels, reactive oxygen species generation, antioxidant status, mitochondrial calcium level, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining was performed to determine early/late apoptotic event.Mangiferin induced cell death in RD cells with an IC50 value of 70 \u03bcM. The cytotoxic effect was reflected in a dose-dependent increase in lactate dehydrogenase leakage and nitric oxide release during mangiferin treatment. Mangiferin caused dose dependent increase in reactive oxygen species generation, intracellular calcium levels with subsequent decrease in antioxidant status (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, and glutathione) and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in RD cells. Further data from fluorescence microscopy suggest that mangiferin caused cell shrinkage and nuclear condensation along with the occurrence of a late event of apoptosis.Results of the present study shows that mangiferin can act as a promising chemopreventive agent against RD by inducing sustained oxidative stress.

aVAcute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an immune-mediated disease of the brain that follows viral infection or vaccination, or even appears spontaneously. The objective of the study was to evaluate the clinical, neuroimaging and laboratory profiles of children with ADEM. Seventeen children admitted to the Pediatric Department of Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, whose cases were consistent with the diagnosis of ADEM, were included. Their clinical and neuroimaging profiles and outcomes were studied. The most common presenting features were fever (71%), altered sensorium (59%) and headache and convulsions (41%). Brain MRI identified lesions in subcortical white matter (75%) and periventricular white matter (38%). Most patients were treated with corticosteroids. A favorable outcome was seen in 88% of patients. Although 59% of patients had neurologic sequelae at discharge, only one patient had a major neurological deficit at follow-up. Prognosis for survival and outcome was good in the majority of patients. Neurological sequelae at discharge do not predict poor outcome.

VAn unexpected cause of orbital apex syndrome in an immune-competent elderly male.
p2295
aVInvasive aspergillosis causing orbital apex syndrome (OAS) in an immune-competent individual is a very rare phenomenon, scarcely reported in medical literature. A 68-year-old male presented with progressive loss of vision in the right eye, starting after a cataract surgery. Neurological examination suggested OAS. Imaging was suggestive of mass lesion causing destruction of ethmoid bone. Biopsy of the lesion could not be done initially in view of its proximity to the major neuro-vascular bundle in the orbital apex and cavernous sinus and the major risk involved in the procedure relative to its yield. There was no response to empirical therapy with antibacterials, steroids or Amphotericin-B. Gradually the mass increased in size and was amenable to biopsy. Endoscopy guided biopsy revealed invasive aspergillosis. Switching over to voriconazole lead to successful management. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and selection of an appropriate antifungal therapy in the management of invasive aspergillosis.

aVHere we report the detection of Sneathia species most closely related to Sneathia sanguinegens, an infrequently reported bacterium, in the cerebrospinal fluid of a neonate by a culture independent method. Even though on rare occasions, this bacterium was isolated previously from the blood of neonatal bacteraemia cases. To the best of our knowledge there exists no previous report of detection of S. sanguinegens in the cerebrospinal fluid even though recently there has been a report of isolation of closely related species, Leptotrichia amnionii. The neonate recovered following antimicrobial therapy for 21 days. We conclude that uncultivable or difficult- to-cultivate bacteria like Sneathia could be an emerging pathogen for neonatal infection.

All of them were of paediatric age group. Symptoms included pain, swelling, and decreased range of motion of affected joint. On examination synovitis was present in all patients. Roentgenograms & Ultrasonography were inconclusive in all patients, Definitive diagnosis was made only after arthrotomy, Thorn fragments (Acacia arabica) were recovered from the hypertrophied synovium & subtotal synovectomy was done and sent for histopathological examination. All patients improved after surgery with mean residual flexion deformity of 12.5 ± 2.86°. Plant thorn induced synovitis of elbow is rare, it must be included in the differential diagnosis of monoarthritis of elbow and a high index of suspicion is needed for retained thorn fragments in elbow joint causing synovitis. Its optimal treatment is arthrotomy, foreign body removal and total/subtotal synovectomy.

VHabitual dislocation of patella: A review.
p2313
aVHabitual dislocation of patella is a condition where the patella dislocates whenever the knee is flexed and spontaneously relocates with extension of the knee. It is also termed as obligatory dislocation as the patella dislocates completely with each flexion and extension cycle of the knee and the patient has no control over the patella dislocating as he or she moves the knee(1). It usually presents after the child starts to walk, and is often well tolerated in children, if it is not painful. However it may present in childhood with dysfunction and instability. Very little literature is available on habitual dislocation of patella as most of the studies have combined cases of recurrent dislocation with habitual dislocation. Many different surgical techniques have been described in the literature for the treatment of habitual dislocation of patella. No single procedure is fully effective in the surgical treatment of habitual dislocation of patella and a combination of procedures is recommended.

School going students in age group 11-18 years of Chandigarh (Union Territory) India, who were in competitive sports, were included for this survey after taking informed consent from concerned school authorities. 33 schools consisting of 36.165 students were analysed in the study, 7230 students were found to participate in 40 different categories of sports.Total of 246 filled questionnaires were analyzed making it an injury frequency of 3.40% among 7230 participating young athletes in 12 months study duration. Estimated incidence rate, considering hours of exposure in practice, came out to be 48.07 injuries per 1000 h of exposure in practice among 246 injured cases. 40.2% of the injured children (99/246) attributed their injury to poor ground condition while other 30.5% (75/246) to faulty techniques. Rest attributed their injuries to poor fitness levels, improper use of equipment and other reasons. Of the 33 schools surveyed, 27.3% (9/33) had a doctor as health professional, 9.1% (2/33) had a physiotherapist while 66.6% of the schools (22/33) had no health care professional.The incidence of sports injuries in the region is high as compared to the global data. The findings has highlighted the need for a nationwide surveillance system and then taking appropriate measures for future injury prevention and appropriate management.

p2319
aVManagement of femoral diaphyseal fracture in the age group of 5-16 years is controversial. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of intramedullary fixation of femoral shaft fractures by using titanium elastic nailing system (TENS).Between April 2011 and April 2014, 40 pediatric patients (31 boys, 9 girls) aged 5-16 years with diaphyseal femoral fractures were treated by retrograde TENS fixation. Fractures were classified according to system of Winquest and Hansen as Grade-I (n = 18), Grade-II (n = 10), Grade-III (n = 7) and compound fractures according to the Gustilo and Anderson's classification Grade-I (n = 3), Grade-II (n = 2). The final results were evaluated by using Flynn's criteria.The mean duration of follow-up was 21 months (range 3-39 months). All fractures were radiologically united with grade 3 callus formation at 8-10 weeks period (mean 9 weeks) and full weight bearing was possible in a mean time of 9.5 weeks. According to Flynn's criteria, excellent result was found in 33 patients (82.5%) and satisfactory in 7 patients (17.5%). Limb lengthening was noticed in 6 cases, varus mal-alignment was in 4 cases and rotational mal-alignment was seen in 3 cases. Peri-operative difficulties encountered were failure of closed reduction in 4 cases and cork screwing of nails in 2 cases.TENS is a safe and effective method for the treatment of pediatric femoral shaft fractures, because it is minimally invasive, relatively easy to use and shows very good functional and cosmetic results.

aVIsolated trapezio-metacarpal joint dislocation is uncommon and challenging since controversy still exists regarding its management.We present a short case series in which direct repair of trapezio-metacarpal ligaments was done in three patients who had isolated, unstable dislocation of the thumb carpometacarpal joint. All of them were engaged in tasks where no compromise in hand functions and grip strength was affordable. The dislocation was addressed primarily by repair of volar oblique and dorsoradial ligaments with suture anchors. The joint was immobilised in a cast for 4 weeks followed by gradual mobilisation.At an average follow up of 15 months, all the three patients have no restriction in the range of motion. There are no symptoms and signs of instability. In two patients, there is no pain at all; while one patient has occasional pain which is mild and does not interfere with the hand function. Radiographic examination showed normal joint alignment and no signs of subluxation or early osteoarthritis.Repair of the capsuloligamentous complex with suture anchors may be considered as a treatment option in unstable trapezio-metacarpal joint dislocations in high demand patients.

VSacroiliac tuberculosis - A neglected differential in refractory low back pain - Our series of 35 patients.
p2334
aVOsteo-articular tuberculosis accounts for 1-3% of which 5-8% involves sacro-illiac joint. Isolated sacroiliac involvement is very rare. It usually presents as vague back pain. Plain radiographs are often inconclusive. Due to rarity of lesion, vague symptoms and non-conclusive X-rays the diagnosis is further delayed. We present a series of 35 patients presented with sacroiliac tuberculosis.35 patients were diagnosed of sacroiliac tuberculosis from January 2008 to December 2011. After a thorough history and clinical examination, patients were taken up for X-rays and MRI scans. Ultrasound guided needle aspiration was done from suspected area. After histological confirmation of the diagnosis, patients were treated with anti tubercular therapy.Persistent low back pain and difficulty with walking were noted in all patients. There were 21 males (60%) and 14 females and the age ranged from 22 to 55 years (mean: 27 years). Most of the patients (91.4%) had unilateral disease (32 patients). Results of conservative management were good. 21 (60%) of our patients achieved bony ankylosis at the end of study. 9 patients did not respond to conservative management where surgical debridement was done. 4 of these cases had MDR tuberculosis.Sacroiliac tuberculosis must be kept as a differential in all refractory low back pain particularly in endemic areas. MRI is very helpful in early diagnosis of disease. In the early stages of the infection aspiration using a closed needle biopsy is recommended. An open biopsy is essential when the aspirate yields no growth. Open debridement should be done in those not responding to conservative management.

VEvaluation of proximal femoral locking plate in unstable extracapsular proximal femoral fractures: Surgical technique & mid term follow up results.
p2337
aVStable trochanteric femur fractures can be treated successfully with conventional implants such as sliding hip screw, cephalomedullary nails, angular blade plates. However comminuted and unstable inter or subtrochanteric fractures with or without osteoporosis are challenging & prone to complications. The PF-LCP is a new implant that allows angular stability by creating fixed angle block for treatment of complex, comminuted proximal femoral fractures.We reviewed 30 patients with unstable inter or subtrochanteric fractures, which were stabilized with PF-LCP. Mean age of patient was 65 years, and average operative time was 80 min. Patients were followed up for a period of 3 years (June 2010-June 2013). Patients were examined regularly at 3 weekly interval for signs of union (radiological & clinical), varus collapse (neck-shaft angle), limb shortening, and hardware failure.All patients showed signs of union at an average of 9 weeks (8-10 weeks), with minimum varus collapse (<10°), & no limb shortening and hardware failure. Results were analysed using IOWA (Larson) hip scoring. Average IOWA hip score was 77.5.PF-LCP represents a feasible alternative for treatment of unstable inter- or subtrochanteric fractures.

aVMinimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) is an established technique for fixation of fractures of the distal third tibia. Our study aimed to manage intra articular and extraarticular fractures of the distal third tibia by the minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis technique and follow them prospectively. Clinical and radiological outcomes were studied and clinical indications & efficacy of the procedure reviewed. Though many studies on the subject have been done previously, these have been retrospective reviews or small series.From May 2010 to May 2013, 50 patients of closed distal tibial fractures were operated by MIPO technique with a distal tibial anatomical locking plate having 4.5/5 proximal and 3.5/4 distal screw holes. The follow up duration was for 3 years.The mean fracture healing time was 21.4 weeks (range 16-32 weeks) and average AOFAS score 95.06 was out of a total possible 100 points. At last follow up, superficial infection occurred in 5 patients (10%); deep infection, implant failure and malunion in 1-patient each (2%).MIPO technique provides good, though slightly delayed bone healing and decreases incidence of nonunion and need for bone grafting. This technique should be used in distal tibia fractures where locked nailing cannot be done like fractures with small distal metaphyseal fragments, vertical splits, markedly comminuted fractures and in fractures with intra-articular extension.

aVHigh rate of malunion and non union in displaced fracture clavicle treated conservatively lead to use of different types of internal fixation methods which also were found to be associated with various complications. Moreover their superiority over conservative treatment has not been established. This study was designed to compare clinical outcome of conservative treatment with external fixator in cases with displaced midshaft clavicle fractures.Fifty adult consenting cases of acute midshaft fracture clavicle, displaced >15 mm were included. Twenty five cases were allotted to conservative (group A) and external fixator (group B) each. In group A treatment was given in form of clavicle brace. In group B schanz pins were inserted obliquely between supero-inferior and anterior-posterior direction and connected with rod. The outcome was measured by Constant score, union time and complications.Mean radiographic union time in group A was 23.45 ± 1.40 weeks (with 8% non union and 80% malunion) and in group B it was 9.36 ± 1.49 weeks. Mean Constant score at 6 months in group A was 78.28 ± 6.45 and in group B 92.72 ± 1.48. Mean shortening at 6 months in group A was 19.36 mm. In group B shortening at 6 months was noticed in three cases (6, 5, 6 mm).Close reduction of acute fracture mid clavicle and application of external fixator is a simple procedure providing the benefits of rigid fixation and undisturbed fracture environment. Pain relief is faster, union time is shorter and there are no hardware related problems.

VAnomalous Bilateral Communication between the Inferior Alveolar Nerve and the Auriculotemporal Nerve: A Rare Variation.
p2346
aVBranches of the posterior division of the mandibular nerve show various anomalous communications in the infratemporal region. Understanding such communication has relevance in the management of neuropathies and surgical procedures in this region. This study was conducted to explore such communicating branches, anticipating that they might provide information of clinical significance. A total of 15 human cadavers (30 infratemporal regions) were studied to explore such communicating branches in infratemporal region. The branches of the posterior division of the mandibular nerve were carefully dissected, and these branches were studied and analysed for any abnormal course. In one case, a rare type of bilateral communication between the auriculotemporal nerve and the inferior alveolar nerve, forming a loop with no association with any structure, was observed. It is possible that such communicating branches may be associated with delayed regression of the first arch vessels. The clinical implications of these anomalous communications require further detailed study for improved management of neuropathies and surgical procedures.

Successful cystoscopic removal of 11 foreign bodies comprising four large metallic screws and seven nail-like large sewing needles was done in two sessions. The most prevalent motivation for self-insertion of urethral foreign bodies is autoerotism/psychological impairment. Appropriate surgical technique guided by physical examination/ imaging with endoscopic removal is often successful, depending on the object's physical attributes and morphology while minimizing urothelial trauma and preserving voiding and erectile function. Follow-up cystourethroscopy is important for diagnosing any complications and urothelial injuries.

Wedge resection of the ulcer with primary closure was performed. Histopathology revealed aseptate, broad, obtuse angled fungal hyphae, and invasive mucormycosis was confirmed by special stains like Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Gomori's methenamine silver (GMS). Very few cases of invasive gastric mucormycosis associated with uncontrolled diabetes and alcoholism have been reported in the literature.

p2376
aVMyoepithelial carcinoma (MC) is a malignant salivary gland neoplasm whose tumor cells demonstrate cytologic differentiation toward myoepithelial cells and lack ductal or acinar differentiation. It is a relatively rare tumor and many a times remains undiagnosed because of histopathological heterogeneity. It represents about 0.4-0.6% of all salivary gland tumors and 1.2-1.5% of carcinomas. It occurs predominantly in the parotid gland with a mean age of presentation being 55 years (range 14-86) with no sex predilection. MC appears to be a low grade malignancy when arising in a pleomorphic adenoma, but tends to be more aggressive and has a higher metastatic potential when arising de novo. The clinical behavior of MC is variable and there are no pathologic features that correlate with patients' outcome. Most tumors that display marked cytologic atypia, high mitotic activity and necrosis tend to behave aggressively. The current case is of a 42-year-old male with recurrent tumor mass in the mandibular right posterior region. The purpose of this article was to describe the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical features of intraoral MC and to discuss review of literature of this rare tumor.

VParosteal osteosarcoma: Report of a rare juxtacortical variant of osteosarcoma affecting the maxilla.
p2391
aVParosteal osteosarcomas are rare, low-grade juxtacortical variant of osteosarcoma, especially in the jaws, representing 1.6% of all bony malignant tumours and upto 5% of all osteosarcomas. Only 12 cases of intraoral parosteal osteosarcomas have been reported in the English literature. In the jaws males are more commonly affected with peak occurrence at 39 years and nearly equal site predilection for maxilla and mandible. Radiographically, parosteal osteosarcomas are radiodense, lobulated masses with a broad stalk to the cortex of the bone with no periosteal reaction and medullary invasion. Microscopically, shows well-differentiated tumor with minimum atypia and rare mitotic figures separating trabeculae of woven bone. Unlike classical and periosteal osteosarcoma, it is considered to have a good prognosis. A case report of this rare entity in 22-year-old female patient with bony hard, painless swelling of 9 months duration in maxillary premolar-molar region is presented. The need for differential diagnostic approach is emphasized from other seemingly benign clinical entities.

VNecrotizing sialometaplasia: A diagnostic dilemma!
p2400
aVNecrotizing sialometaplasia (NS) is a benign, self-limiting inflammatory reaction of salivary gland tissue which may mimic squamous cell carcinoma or mucoepidermoid carcinoma, both clinically and histologically, that creates diagnostic dilemma leading to unwarranted aggressive surgery. Most commonly affected site is the minor salivary glands of the palate. The pathogenesis is unknown but is believed to be due to ischemia of vasculature supplying the salivary gland lobules. A simple incisional biopsy is required to confirm the histological diagnosis and to rule out more serious disease processes. It is a self-limiting disease process and requires no treatment. It will be prudent to do repeat biopsy in case if the lesion does not heal within 3 months.

aVLangerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) is a disease process characterized by accumulation and infiltration of cells, showing ultrastructural and immunohistochemical similarities to Langerhans' cell, in the affected tissues. It exhibits extreme clinical heterogeneity. LCH was historically divided into 3 clinical entities based on extent of tissue involvement and severity of presentation. These 3 entities were eosinophilic granuloma, Hand-Schuler-Christian disease, Letterer-Siwe disease. Owing to similarities of their histologic appearance, they were grouped together under the term histiocytosis X. It was recently changed to LCH, emphasizing the primary cell involved in the disease process. LCH is a rare disease with an incidenceestimated to be 4.0 to 5.4 per million population. Males are affected twice as frequently as females. The disease may occur at any age with peak incidence in children aged 1 to 3 years. We describe an unusual case of a 65-year-old man who presented with painless swelling in anterior region of mandible.

VAn update on intraoral application of colposcopy.
p2409
aVColposcopy is an established technique for diagnosis in gynecology. Many premalignant and malignant lesions in these areas have discernible characteristics which can be detected using a colposcope, providing an enlarged view of the areas, allowing the colposcopist to visually distinguish normal from abnormal appearing tissue and take directed biopsies for further pathological examination. The diagnosis of a dysplastic lesion of the oral mucosa cannot be based solely on clinical findings. Therefore, histological evaluation of a representative biopsy specimen is necessary. The site for the biopsy is a subjective choice that sometimes raises doubts about its representativeness. So far, no simple and reliable method is available for selecting the most appropriate area for biopsy. Intraoral microscopy (oral application of the colposcopy technique) of mucosal lesions seems to offer advantages in selecting more representative sites for biopsy than routine clinical examination alone. The biopsy sites identified by direct oral microscopy show more advanced histologic signs than those selected by routine clinical examination. This article enlightens the application of colposcopy in diagnosis of oral premalignant lesions and malignant lesions.

aVOral soft tissues are affected by numerous pathologic conditions of variable etiology and hence their appropriate management relies on their accurate diagnosis. Clinical identification of intact vesicle and bulla in the oral cavity is really a challenge due to the regular irritation and the friable nature of oral mucosa. Rupture of these lesions leads to erosions or ulcerations on the surface, hence making the diagnosis of vesiculobullous (VB) lesions is even more difficult due to the fact that the differential diagnosis along with VB lesions will also include ulcerative, immunological-mediated diseases, and neoplasms and systemic diseases. Hence, knowledge of the clinical presentation of these disorders and the relevant diagnostic procedures is important not just for dermatologists, but also for general practitioners and dentists. In this article, the various procedures have been explained that can be used for the diagnostic purpose of VB lesions.

VEpithelial and stromal patterns of pleomorphic adenoma of minor salivary glands: A histopathological and histochemical study.
p2421
aVPleomorphic adenoma (PA) accounts for 45-74% of all the salivary gland neoplasms, of which 40-70% are present in minor salivary glands. Studies have depicted variations in histological typing and classification of these tumors. Its pleomorphism is attributed to the cytological differentiations of the epithelial components and the diverse stromal components. Biochemical investigations of saliva have revealed "mucins" to be its main component. Mucins reflect in their composition, the functional state of the mucosa, both in health and disease. Many reviews on histochemical classification and identification have been put forward to explain the intricacies of mucins; however, no attempts have been made to classify salivary gland tumors based on their mucin profiles and assess its prognostic significance. Thus, this study was executed to analyze the clinical, histopathological and histochemical behavior of PA of minor salivary glands and decipher a correlation.Twenty-six diagnosed cases of PA of minor salivary glands and five controls of normal minor salivary glands of the hard palate were included in the study. Blocks were retrieved, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) stain as well as combined Alcian blue (AB)-periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stains.The stained slides revealed an array of epithelial and stromal patterns and varying heterogeneity of mucin expression of normal and neoplastic minor salivary glands.The study elucidated the role of mucins in tumorigenesis and its prognostic implications.

Alterations in expression of Glut-1 have been reported in several pre-malignant and malignant lesions. The objectives of the present study were to compare the expression of Glut-1 in normal persons and in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), to correlate the expression of Glut-1 with respect to clinical staging of OSCC and to evaluate the expression of Glut-1 with respect to different histopathological grades of OSCC.Thirty cases of OSCC were staged clinically and graded histopathologically. Immunohistochemical method was used to detect the expression of Glut-1 in OSCC and the same was compared with the normal subjects. The scores were compared using the chi-square test.Glut-1 expression was detected in all grades of OSCC. A significant correlation with a P value of 0.00004 was found in immunostaining between normal and OSCC. The expression of Glut-1 was significant when compared with different clinical stages with significant P value of 0.0004 and in different histopathological grades of OSCC with a P value of 0.00001.Higher immunohistochemical staining scores were obtained with increased clinical staging and histopathological grades of OSCC. High expression of Glut-1 may be related to poor prognosis in OSCC.

VCytokeratin 14 and cytokeratin 18 expressions in reduced enamel epithelium and dentigerous cyst: Possible role in oncofetal transformation and histogenesis- of follicular type of adenomatoid odontogenic tumor.
p2427
aVOdontogenic cysts and tumors arise from the structures and remnants associated with tooth development. Cysts and tumors derived from the odontogenic tissues constitute an unusually diverse group of lesions. This diversity reflects the complex development of the dental structures, since all these lesions originate through some alteration from the normal pattern of odontogenesis. Cytokeratin (CK) 14 is the typical intermediary filament of odontogenic epithelium, CK 18 is the major components of the intermediate filaments of simple or single layered epithelial tissue; it is not expressed in stratified squamous epithelium. The present study was undertaken to understand the expression pattern of these cytokeratins in dentigerous cyst, dental follicular tissue, adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT) and unicystic ameloblastoma.The present study consists of 60 specimens consisting of 20 samples of Dentigerous cyst, 20 samples of Reduced enamel epithelium/dental follicles, 10 samples of Follicular type of AOT, 10 samples of unicystic ameloblastoma. The sections of these specimens were stained for CK 14 and CK 18. The number of cells positive for CK 14 and CK 18 was counted per 100 cells. The cells were counted in four randomly selected high-power fields and the mean was calculated. Scoring of cytokeratin 14 expressions was done using Remmele score.The highest expression of cytokeratin 14 was noted in AOT, least was seen in dental follicle/Reduced enamel epithelium (REE). CK18 was negative in all the cases included in the present study.In the present study, the expression of CK14 was noted in AOT, Dentigerous cyst (DC), Unicystic Ameloblastoma (UCA) and Dental follicle/REE. The expressions between these lesions were compared. These expression pattern may provide an insight to the histogenesis of AOT.

aVSquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) comprises 80% of the cancers of the oral cavity. Metastases to the cervical lymph nodes affects prognosis. Studying lymph node reactivity may help to understand host immune reaction against the tumor and thus influence prognosis.This study observed patterns of lymph node reactivity, metastases and grades of metastases in cervical lymph nodes and compared them with the histopathology of the primary tumor.Lymph nodes from 30 patients of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) were taken. 10 of these were well-differentiated SCC (WDSCC), 10 moderately differentiated SCC (MDSCC) and 10 poorly differentiated SCC (PDSCC). Four immunomorphological patterns were observed: lymphocyte predominance, germinal centre predominance, mixed pattern (sinus histiocytosis) and unstimulated pattern.Chi square test.The predominant lymph node reactive patterns were germinal centre predominance (79.27%), unstimulated pattern (14.63%) and lymphocyte predominance (6.10%). Positive nodes showed invasion in the form of islands (57.14%), cords (39.29%) and total replacement pattern (3.57%). Tumor involvement in positive nodes showed grade 3 invasion, (53.57%), grade 2 invasion (26.79%), grade 4 invasion (17.86%) and grade 1 invasion (1.79%). Statistically significant association was found between: Lymph node reactive pattern and histopathological grade of primary tumor. Higher numbers of germinal centre predominance lymph nodes were found in WDSCC and MDSCCHistopathological grade of primary tumor and the grade of lymph node invasion.Immuno-morphological assessment of draining lymph nodes reflects the immune status of the patient with respect to metastases. This may facilitate identification of high and low risk patients and help in planning appropriate therapy for the high-risk patients.

aVCentral and Peripheral giant cell granulomas of jaws are uncommon, benign, reactive disorders that are characterized by the presence of numerous multinucleated giant cells and mononuclear cells within a stroma. The origin of the multinucleated giant cells is controversial; probably originating from fusion of histiocytes, endothelial cells and fibroblasts.To assess the expression of CD34 and CD68 in central and peripheral giant cell granulomas to understand the origin of these multinucleated giant cells.Twenty cases of Central and Peripheral giant cell granulomas were evaluated immunohistochemically for CD34 and CD68 proteins expression.Immunopositivity for CD34 was seen only in cytoplasm of endothelial cells of blood vessels; whereas, consistent cytoplasmic immunopositivity for CD68 was seen in few stromal cells. Statistical significance was seen in mean number of multinucleated giant cells, mean number of nuclei in multinucleated giant cells, CD68 expression and ratio of macrophages to multinucleated giant cells among two lesions.Although the central giant cell granulomas share some clinical and histopathological similarities with peripheral giant cell granulomas, differences in mean number of nuclei in multinucleated giant cells and CD68 immunoreactivity may underlie the distinct clinical behavior.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the sections was then carried out of all the sections. The area of interest on H and E stained section was marked and this marking was later superimposed onto the corresponding unstained sections and were subjected to SEM analysis.OKC at ×1000 magnification showed many prominent desmosomes. However, an increase in the intercellular space was also noted. SEM analysis demonstrated similar findings with the presence of many desmosomes, though they were seen to be damaged and fragile. H and E stained DC under oil immersion did not show any prominent desmosomes. SEM analysis of the same confirmed the observation and very minimal number were seen with a very condense arrangement of the epithelial cells. RC at ×1000 magnification revealed plenty of desmosomes, which were again confirmed by SEM.The number and quality of desmosomal junctions in all the cysts has a role in the clinical behavior of the cyst.

However, clinical toxicologists occasionally encounter cases of severe systemic toxicity. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states that 'GlySH' is of relatively low oral and acute dermal toxicity. It does not have anticholinesterase effect and no organophosphate-like central nervous system (CNS) effects. The clinical features range from skin and throat irritation to hypotension and death. Severe GlySH-surfactant poisoning is manifested by gastroenteritis, respiratory disturbances, altered mental status, hypotension refractory to the treatment, renal failure, and shock.[1] GlySH intoxication has a case fatality rate 3.2-29.3%. Pulmonary toxicity and renal toxicity seem to be responsible for mortality. Metabolic acidosis, abnormal chest X-ray, arrhythmias, and elevated serum creatinine levels are useful prognostic factors for predicting GlySH mortality.[2] There is no antidote and the mainstay of treatment for systemic toxicity is decontamination and aggressive supportive therapy. We report a case of acute pulmonary edema, which is a rare but severe manifestation of oral GlySH poisoning, where patient survived with aggressive supportive therapy.

Flubendiamide is a new generation pesticide, reported to have better activity against Lepidopteran insects. The present study was carried out with an objective to analyze the effects of flubendiamide sub-acute exposure on hematology of rats.Male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (9-11 weeks) were divided into five groups with six animals in each group. First group served as control, while the rest were exposed to ascending oral doses of flubendiamide (125, 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg) for 28 days. After the trial period, blood was collected in heparinized vials and analyzed using Siemens ADVIA 2120(®) autoanalyzer. Various erythrocytic, platelet and leukocyte parameters were measured and analyzed using statistical tests by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-test using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)(®) 20 software.After processing the data through statistical analysis, it was observed that the effect of flubendiamide exposure on female rats was negligible. The only significant change observed in the female rats was that in total erythrocytic count, while rest of the parameters showed non-significant bidirectional changes. In males, many parameters viz., total leukocyte count (TLC), total erythrocyte count (TEC), packed cell volume (PCV), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), platelet count (PC), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), hemoglobin distribution width (HDW), large platelets (LPT) and plateletcrit (PCT) expressed significant difference when compared to control.Many of the changes were dose independent, but sex specific. This lead to the hypothesis that saturation toxicokinetics might be one of the reasons for this varied response, which can only be evaluated after further testing.

In vitro cytotoxicity was performed in A549 cell lines and IC50 values were used to compare the cytotoxicity of formulation with pure RPT. In vivo repeated dose toxicity study was undertaken using Wistar rats at three different doses for 28-days by intratracheal insufflations method.The results of DST study revealed sensitivity of tubercle bacteria to RLDPI at concentration equivalent to 10 \u03bcg/mL of RPT. This study confirmed anti-TB potential of RPT in spray-dried RLDPI, though the spray drying method is reported to reduce activity of drugs. Cytotoxicity study in A549 cells demonstrated that RPT when encapsulated in liposomes as RLDPI was safe to cells as compared to pure RPT. In vivo toxicity study revealed that RPT in the form of RLDPI was safe at 1 and 5 mg/kg dose. However, mortality was seen at higher dose (10 mg/kg), possibly because of liver and kidney damage.Thus, these studies demonstrated safety of RLDPI for the treatment of pulmonary TB.

VA study on neurobehavioral performance of workers occupationally exposed to solvent in synthetic resin manufacturing.
p2486
aVOne major effect of occupational solvent exposure is central nervous system (CNS) impairment, ranging from depression to encephalopathy with cognitive, behavioral changes. Exposures in industries being varied, classification of health outcomes for different exposures is important.This study assessed neurobehavioral performance of synthetic resin manufacturing workers exposed to organic solvent, mainly formalin.This cross-sectional study selected subjects by random selection from all such workers of an Indian city. Questionnaire survey and assessment by a neurobehavioral test battery (NBT) was undertaken.Comparison between actual and allied workers observed significant difference in tweezer dexterity, card sorting and backward memory scores. Significant effect of exposure was observed on tweezer dexterity, card sorting, and hand dynamometer scores.Changes of neurobehavioral performance might occur following solvent exposure and these changes might have a relationship with the quantum of exposure. Periodic examination of workers with NBT is needed for detection of early neurotoxic effects.

VAntimutagenic effect of dioscorea pentaphylla on genotoxic effect induced by methyl methanesulfonate in the Drosophila wing spot test.
p2489
aVPlants as dietary sources are known to have several chemoprotective agents. Dioscorea pentaphylla is an important medicinal plant, which is often used as edible food. This study was undertaken to evaluate the antigenotoxic potential of D. pentaphylla extracts on the genotoxic effect induced by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) in the Drosophila wing spot test.The somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) was carried out in Drosophila melanogaster. In transheterogyous larvae, multiple wing hair (mwh 3-0.3) and flare (flr3-38.8) genes were used as markers of the extent of mutagenicity.It was observed thatall the three extracts (petroleum ether, choloroform, and ethyl alcohol) in the combined treatment had significantly inhibited the effect of MMS-induced genotoxic effects. When compared to others, the ethanol extract showed a very significant antimutagenic activity.The compounds that are present in the extracts may directly interact with the methyl radical groups of MMS and inactivate them by chemical reaction. It is also possible that the compounds in the extract compete to interact with the nucleophilic sites in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), thus altering the binding of the mutagen to these sites. Although our results indicate that the compounds present in the extracts may directly interact with the methyl radical groups of MMS and inactivate them by chemical reaction, it may also be quite interesting to investigate through the other different mechanisms by which D. pentaphylla could interfere in vivo on the effect of genotoxic agents.

aVHerbo-mineral formulations are being successfully used in therapeutics since centuries. But recently, they came under the scanner for their metallic contents especially the presence of heavy metals. Hence it is the need of the hour to assess and establish the safety of these formulations through toxicity studies. In line with the various toxicity studies that are being carried out, Government of India expressed the need for conducting genotoxicity studies of different metal- or mineral-based drugs. Till date very few Ayurvedic herbo-mineral formulations have been studied for their genotoxic potential. The present study is aimed to evaluate the genotoxic potential of Hridayarnava Rasa.It was prepared as per classical guidelines and administered to Swiss albino mice for 14 consecutive days. Chromosomal aberration and sperm abnormality assay were done to evaluate the genotoxic potential of the test drugs. Cyclophosphamide (CP) was taken as positive group and results were compared.All treated groups exhibited significant body weight gain in comparison to CP group. Results revealed no structural deformity in the above parameters in comparison to the CP-treated group.Reported data showed that both tested samples of Hridayarnava Rasa does not possess genotoxic potential under the experimental conditions and can be safely used.

p2495
aVFree radicals are one of the frequent products of normal cellular metabolism. Disparity of metabolism and excessive generation of free radicals predisposes to disorders like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and aging phenomenon. Curculigo orchioides Gaertn. is known for "adaptogen" and "aphrodisiac" activity and has been proved for antiasthmatic, estrogenic, antiosteoporotic activity along with protection from cisplatin-induced cell damage. C. orchioides was powdered and subjected to soxhlet extraction using methanol. Phytochemical studies and estimation of polyphenols and flavonoids was performed. Acute toxicity studies were performed by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD guidelines. Animals were treated with cyclophosphamide to induce neurotoxicity. Curculigo orchioides was powdered and subjected to soxhlet extraction using methanol. Catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and lipid peroxidation were estimated by reported methods. C. orchioides (400 mg/kg) significantly promoted restoration of catalase (P < 0.005), superoxide dismutase (P < 0.005), and glutathion (P < 0.05) levels. Similarly, a very significant decrease (P < 0.005) in the levels of malondialdehyde was observed. In all cases as mentioned previously, C. orchioides at dose 200 mg/kg promoted significant (P < 0.05) restoration of enzyme levels. C. orchioides (Kali Musli) is rich source of phytochemicals like flavonoids and polyphenols. Flavonoids and polyphenols are reputed to demonstrate neuroprotective effect. These phytochemicals in the present study might be responsible to demonstrate neuroprotective effect.

Gentamicin 80 mg/kg i.m., calcium carbonate 0.5 g/kg/day oral, calcium carbonate 1.0 g/kg/day oral, and verapamil 7 mg/kg/day i.m. were administered for 6 days in either species containing 7 groups. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine and, urine protein levels were assessed on day 0 and day 7 for kidney function. The animals were sacrificed on day 7 for histopathplogical examination and kidney superoxide dismutase levels (SOD) were measured. Statistical analysis was done using student's unpaired t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant.The results showed that calcium was able to reverse significantly increased BUN, serum creatinine, urine protein, and reduced kidney SOD levels in gentamicin-treated nephrotoxic rats or rabbits in a dose-dependent manner while verapamil had no protective or nephrotoxic effect.Calcium 0.5 g/kg/day and 1.0 g/kg/day were able to reverse tubular necrosis and mesangial proliferation in gentamicin-treated nephrotoxic animals. There was no species-sensitive variation in reversal of nephrotoxicity by calcium in rats and rabbits.

aVThe use of natural polymers in designing of matrix tablets for sustained-release drug delivery systems has received much attention.The study involves the development and optimization of in situ cross-linked matrix tablets for sustained salbutamol sulfate release.In situ cross-linked matrix tablets of salbutamol sulfate were prepared by direct compression and optimized by response surface methodology based on 32 factorial design. The influence on sodium alginate and a calcium salt (calcium carbonate) amounts in salbutamol sulfate matrix tablets on the properties like drug release and hardness of salbutamol sulfate sustained release matrix tablets were analyzed by response surface plots and corresponding contour plots. Drug contents, weight variations, hardness, and in vitro drug release with release kinetic analysis of these newly developed matrix tablets were also investigated.All these in situ cross-linked salbutamol sulfate matrix tablets showed satisfactory drug contents, weight variations, hardness and prolonged sustained release of salbutamol sulfate over 6 h.The developed salbutamol sulfate matrix tablets might be beneficial over the conventional tablets to decrease the dosing frequency and enhanced patient compliance.

p2504
aVA simple, fast, and robust micellar LC method was developed for the separation and identification of the nonpermitted color malachite green in green pea and some ready-to-eat foodstuffs. Malachite green (4-[(4-dimethylaminophenyl) phenyl-methyl]-N,N-dimethylaniline) is a hazardous dye that is used to treat fungal and protozoan infections in fish and is a common adulterant (coloring agent) in green pea and other green vegetables because of its green color. In the present work, malachite green was determined in various foodstuffs using a direct injection technique on an RP C18 column with isocratic elution. The optimum mobile phase consisted of 0.15 M sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 6% pentanol buffered at pH 5. Detection was carried out at 620 nm. Malachite green was eluted in 9.2 min without any interference caused by endogenous compounds. Linearities (r > 0.9999), intraday and interday precision (RSD less than 1.00%) in micellar media, and robustness were studied for method validation. LOD and LOQ were 0.10 and 0.25 ppm, respectively. The simplicity of the developed method makes it useful for routine analysis in the area of food QC.

aVThis paper describes a method that includes an optimized extraction process and identification and quantification of two anticancer compounds (garcinol and isogarcinol) by LC/electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS/MS in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The study aimed to develop a fast, accurate, and sensitive method for the quantification of garcinol and isogarcinol in different extracts of Garcinia indica fruits. The compounds were detected using LC/ESI-MS/MS in the positive-ion mode and quantified in the MRM mode using a transition mass of m/z 603.3/411 taken as the quantifier and 603.3/343.2 as the qualifier for garcinol and isogarcinol. Five point calibration curves were linear in the range of 2 to 10 ng/mL for garcinol and 0.5 to 6 ng/mL for isogarcinol, with a correlation coefficient of \u22650.990 for both. LOQ for garcinol and isogarcinol was 0.06 and 0.05 ng/mL, respectively, while LOD was 0.021 and 0.017 ng/mL respectively. Our work demonstrated optimization of extraction procedure, fast and highly sensitive quantification (pg level LOQ), and validation of the developed method for the investigated compounds in fruit extracts of G. indica.

aVTo provide normal macular thickness measurements using Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SDOCT, Copernicus, Optopol Technologies, Zawierci, Poland).Fifty-eight eyes of 58 healthy subjects were included in this prospective study. All subjects had comprehensive ophthalmic examination including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). All the subjects underwent Copernicus SDOCT. Central foveal thickness (CFT) and photoreceptor layer (PRL) thickness were measured and expressed as mean and standard deviation. Mean retinal thickness for each of the 9 regions defined in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study was reported. The data were compared with published literature in Indians using Stratus and Spectralis OCTs to assess variation in instrument measurements.The mean CFT in the study sample was 173.8 ± 18.16 microns (131-215 microns) and the mean PRL thickness was 65.48 ± 4.23 microns (56-74 microns). No significant difference (p = 0.148) was found between CFT measured automated (179.28 ± 22 microns) and manually (173.83 ± 18.1 microns). CFT was significantly lower in women (167.62 ± 16.36 microns) compared to men (180.03 ± 18 microns) (p = 0.008). Mean retinal thickness reported in this study was significantly different from published literature using Stratus OCT and Spectralis OCT.We report the normal mean retinal thickness in central 1 mm area to be between 138 and 242 microns in Indian population using Copernicus SDOCT. We suggest that different OCT instruments cannot be used interchangeably for the measurement of macular thickness as they vary in segmentation algorithms.

aVIn this study, a three step purification of alkaline phosphatase from non-pasteurized milk has been described. It included cream extraction, n-butanol treatment and acetone precipitation. Different parameters such as buffer concentration, temperature, pH, substrate concentration, acetone and n-butanol treatment were optimized to maximize the enzyme activity. The enzyme was fruitfully purified up to homogeneity from the milk, with percentage recovery and fold purification of 56.17 and 17.67 respectively. The kinetic parameters were determined to be 0.927 mM (Km) and 55.86 \u03bcM/min (Vmax), with specific activity of 11.31 U/mg. Other optimized parameters were estimated as a buffer concentration of 0.5 M with pH 9.0, temperature optima at 37 °C, with n-butanol and acetone concentration of 20 % (v/v) and 50 % (v/v) respectively. This approach provides a simple and effective method for the purification of alkaline phosphatase from non-pasteurized milk.

aVWe present a case of a 40-year-old male patient who presented to us with radicular pain in arm for anterior cervical discectomy with fusion. The preanesthetic checkup including indirect laryngoscopy was normal with routine investigations within normal limits. The patient was induced and intubated with the established routine technique without any obvious airway problems. Prophylactic dexamethasone was administered, and the intraoperative course was uneventful. Immediately after extubation, it was noticed that the patient had inspiratory stridor and whispered voice on the operation theater table itself. Assessment by Bonfils retromolar fiberscope under fentanyl sedation revealed bilateral vocal cord edema. The patient was re intubated and put on T piece with humidified O2. After 72-h, patient was extubated after confirming normal vocal cord movement under flexible fiberscope guidance. This case is presented to alert anesthesiologist about the possibility of vocal cord edema even though other potential airway complications are possible. We would also highlight the importance of Bonfils retromolar fiberscope in awake vocal cord examination and flexible fiberscope use in managing patients presenting with airway problems during extubation.

p2532
aVCongenital absence of sternum, also known as sternal cleft, is a rare anomaly. It is due to impaired organogenesis leading to nonfusion of sternal bars. It may be of two types- complete or incomplete. It may be associated with other congenital malformations viz., cardiac, anorectal etc., or may be a part of Cantrell's pentalogy. Besides cosmetic concerns, mediastinal structures are at increased risk to damage in case of trauma to the anterior chest wall. Due to restricted mediastinal space, there may be restrictive pulmonary dysfunctions and unstable hemodynamics. It usually presents in the neonatal period or early infancy, rarely in adult age. The defect should be surgically closed as early as possible. If cardiac arrest occurs due to any reason, the only option is open cardiac massage. We report a case of complete congenital sternal cleft accidentally diagnosed on the operation table, while preparing the patient for diagnostic laparotomy. The patient was retrospectively assessed for the presence of other congenital malformations.

aVThe aim of the study was to compare the effect of mannitol (M) and hypertonic saline (HTS) on brain relaxation and electrolyte balance.Prospective, randomized, double-blind study.A total of 114 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists status II and III, scheduled to undergo craniotomy for supratentorial brain tumor resection were enrolled. Patients received 5 ml/kg 20% mannitol (n = 56) or 3% HTS (n = 58) at the start of scalp incision. Hemodynamics, fluid balance and electrolytes, were measured at 0, 15, 30, and 60 min and 6 h after infusion. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay between the two groups was also recorded. The surgeon assessed brain relaxation on a four-point scale (1 = Relaxed, 2 = Satisfactory, 3 = Firm, 4 = Bulging). Appropriate statistical tests were used for comparison; P < 0.05 was considered significant.Brain relaxation conditions in the HTS group (relaxed/satisfactory/firm/bulging, n = 28/20/5/3) were better than those observed in the M group (relaxed/satisfactory/firm/bulging, n = 17/21/11/9). The levels of serum sodium were higher in the HTS group (P < 0.001). The average urine output was higher in the M group (5.50 ± 0.75 L) than in the HTS group (4.38 ± 0.72 L) (P < 0.005). There was no significant difference in fluid input, ICU stay, and hospital days between the two groups.We concluded that HTS provided better brain relaxation than mannitol during elective supratentorial brain tumor surgery, without affecting ICU and hospital stay.

aVLaryngoscopy and tracheal intubation produce sympathetic overdrive by catecholamine release resulting in hypertension and tachycardia. Various agents are being tried to combat the intubation response over years.This study is aimed at comparing dexmedetomidine which is a highly selective alpha-2 agonist with an ultra-short acting beta blocker, esmolol to see which among the two is better in attenuating the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.This was a prospective randomized double-blind control study.Sixty patients scheduled for general anesthesia were divided into two groups, D and E with 30 patients in each group. Group-D patients received dexmedetomidine 0.5 mcg/kg and Group-E patients received esmolol 0.5 mg/kg as intravenous premedication over 5 min before a rapid sequence induction and tracheal intubation. Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures along with heart rate were measured using invasive arterial line at various time points. The percentage change of hemodynamic parameters at those time points from the baseline was compared between the groups.Descriptive and inferential statistical methods were used to analyze the data.The percentage change of all hemodynamic parameters from base line were less in the dexmedetomidine group than in esmolol group at all-time points of measurement. However, a statistically significant difference was observed often at the time points within 1 min after tracheal intubation.Dexmedetomidine is superior to esmolol in attenuating the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.

aVPain experienced following laparotomy is largely due to abdominal wall incision. Effective mitigation of this pain is vital to improve patient satisfaction and for early ambulation. We evaluated the efficacy of transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block for postoperative analgesia, as a component of multimodal analgesia.Sixty adult ASA physical status I to III patients undergoing emergency laparotomy under general anesthesia were recruited for this double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. The TAP block was performed before skin incision, using the double pop technique in the midaxillary line, at the level of the umbilicus with a 22 gauge blunt needle. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either 25 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine or normal saline (NS), bilaterally. Tramadol was used for postoperative analgesia via a patient-controlled analgesia pump (PCA) along with an intramuscular (IM) injection of diclofenac sodium, 12-hourly. Each patient was assessed in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) immediately after shifting and every two hours thereafter, for 24 hours, for pain, nausea, sedation scores, and pruritus. The two-hourly and total tramadol consumption, over 24 hours, was assessed.The mean total pain scores were significantly less in the TAP block group (48.07 ± 6.76) when compared to the control group (62.63 ± 6.66). The total tramadol consumption was decreased by 36% in the TAP block group (281.33 ± 69.66 mg) compared to the control group (439 ± 68.59 mg). Tramadol consumption measured every two hours was also less up to 18 hours postoperatively, after which, there was an increase in pain scores and tramadol consumption in the TAP block group. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of nausea, vomiting, sedation or pruritis.TAP block is an effective component of the multimodal analgesia regimen for reducing postoperative pain and opioid requirement after emergency laparotomy.

Aim of the study is to compare the view of glottic opening and ease of intubation between Truview(PCD) laryngoscope and Macintosh laryngoscope in patients undergoing general anesthesia (GA).Two hundred patients undergoing elective surgery, under GA were randomized into two groups, Group TV and Group ML. In Group TV, Trueview(PCD) laryngoscope was used initially to visualize the vocal cords for Cormack and Lehane grading (CLG) and to spray the vocal cords with 10% lignocaine. Then the patient was ventilated for 1 min and Macintosh laryngoscope was used to visualize the vocal cords for CLG and proceed with intubation. In Group ML, Macintosh laryngoscope was used initially and later Truview(PCD) laryngoscope. Time to intubation, CLG, number of attempts and hemodynamic parameters were recorded.Ninety-six and 89 patients had CLG1 visualization when Truview(PCD) laryngoscope was used as 1(st) and 2(nd) device respectively compared to 41 and 68 with Macintosh laryngoscope (P = 0.00). Four patients had CLG 4 visualization with Macintosh laryngoscope that turned out to be grade II visualization with Truview(PCD) laryngoscope (P = 0.00). Mean time taken for intubation with Truview(PCD) and Macintosh laryngoscope was 21.10 ± 5.64 s and 15.79 ± 2.76 s respectively (P = 0.00).Better visualization with lesser CLG was found with Truview(PCD) laryngoscope but it took longer time for intubation than Macintosh laryngoscope. The hemodynamic response to intubation was significantly less with the use of Truview(PCD) laryngoscope when compared to that of Macintosh laryngoscope.

VComparison of effects of intravenous clonidine and dexmedetomidine for blunting pressor response during laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation: A randomized control study.
p2553
aVLaryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation activates the sympathetic nervous system, causing tachycardia and hypertension. Dexmedetomidine has an affinity for alpha2 receptors 8 times greater than that of clonidine. It diminishes norepinephrine release and inhibits sympathetic activity leading to decreased heart rate (HR) and blood pressure.The aim was to compare the effect of intravenous (IV) infusion of dexmedetomidine and clonidine on the pressor response among patients undergoing tracheal intubation in elective surgeries under general anesthesia.A prospective, randomized control study.Seventy-five adult patients of age 18-55 years in American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II were included in this study. Patients were allocated randomly into Group P, Group D and Group C of 25 patients each. In the operation theatre, clonidine (3 \u03bcg/kg) or dexmedetomidine (0.5 \u03bcg/kg) or placebo (0.9% normal saline) diluted in 100 ml NaCl 0.9% were infused over a period of 10 min.Statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 15.0. Chi-square test, ANOVA, Student's t-test, and Paired t-test were used.As compared to Group P, the mean systolic blood pressure in Group D and Group C were significantly lower (<0.01) after intubation and all the subsequent intervals. After infusion and after the induction interval, the maximum value was observed in Group D while minimum mean value was observed in Group C. As compared to Group P, the mean arterial pressure in Group D was significantly higher at after infusion and after induction intervals but significantly lower after intubation and subsequent intervals. However, in Group C, the mean value was significantly lower as compared to Group P at all-time intervals except after infusion and after induction intervals. As compared to Group P, the mean HR in Group D was significantly higher at after infusion and after induction intervals. However at all the subsequent intervals, Group D was significantly lower as compared to Group P.It was found that attenuating response to hemodynamic changes were observed with dexmedetomidine and clonidine IV infusion. The early onset of dexmedetomidine makes it a promising choice. Hence premedication with IV infusion of dexmedetomidine can safely be recommended for attenuation of hemodynamic response to endotracheal intubation.

aVRegional anesthesia, increasingly used for infraumbilical surgery, has advantages of decreased stress response to surgery, nausea, vomiting, and cardio-respiratory depression with improved postoperative analgesia, in comparison to general anesthesia. Intrathecal isobaric ropivacaine (RP) had been found, in various clinical studies, to be shorter acting in comparison to bupivacaine (BP). Our present study was, hence, aimed to compare the anesthetic and analgesic efficacy of intrathecal hyperbaric RP relative to hyperbaric BP in lower limb orthopedic surgery.A total of 100 patients aged ranges between 18 and 60 years of either sex, ASAPS 1 and 2, undergoing elective lower limb orthopedic surgeries were divided into two groups, RP group and BP group receiving intrathecal 0.75% RP 3 ml and glucose 50%, 0.5 ml and 0.5% hyperbaric BP 3 ml and 0.9% normal saline 0.5 ml, respectively. The efficacy in terms of onset and duration of anesthesia and analgesia were assessed along with the heart rate, blood pressure at regular intervals throughout the perioperative period.The two study groups were comparable in terms of demography and duration of surgery. Patients in group RP experienced significantly late onset and shorter duration of sensory and motor block in comparison to patients in group BP. There were clinically insignificant differences in perioperative hemodynamics and side-effects noted in each group. Hence, it was observed in this study that equipotent dose of hyperbaric RP had shorter duration of analgesia and anesthesia than with equipotent dose of hyperbaric BP.

VPostspinal hypotension in elderly patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, prophylactic ephedrine versus polygeline 3.5.
p2559
aVPerioperative fluid management in elderly poses considerable challenge to the anesthesiologist. The conventional crystalloid loading may not be a preferred regime in this subgroup of patients since an exaggerated hemodynamic response is expected due to blunted sympathetic response and compromised cardiorespiratory system.This study was designed in the elderly patient for comparing efficacy, side-effects and limitations of prophylactic ephedrine 30 mg (intramuscular [i.m.]) versus polygeline 3.5% 500 ml (intravenous [i.v.]) for the maintenance of blood pressure after subarachnoid block (SAB).The sample size of 100 elderly (age > 50 years) patients undergoing orthopedic surgeries was administered SAB using bupivacaine 0.5% heavy. The primary outcome of this study was the attenuation of hypotension due to SAB using ephedrine or polygeline 3.5%.A total of 100 patients were randomly allocated to receive ephedrine 30 mg i.m. 10 min before the institution of SAB in Group I and preloading with 500 ml of polygeline 3.5% i.v. over 10 min prior to SAB in Group II. Patients in both groups were closely monitored for pulse rate, systolic blood pressure; any hypotension, requirement of rescue therapy and adverse effects.Results were interpreted using Student's t-test for parametric and Chi-square tests for nonparametric data.The incidence of hypotension and requirement for rescue therapy was statistically less in Group I compared with Group II (P < 0.05). Heart rates were better maintained in Group I than Group II, with few hemodynamic adverse effects in both groups.Ephedrine 30 mg i.m. given as pretreatment before SAB in elderly patients was more effective for the prevention of post-SAB hypotension.

aVProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) efficacy in pediatric anesthesia.The aim of this study was to compare PLMA size 2 and 2½ in anesthetized paralyzed pediatric patients weighing 20-30 kg undergoing elective surgery.A prospective randomized study was conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital.A total of 60 American Society of Anesthesiologists I pediatric patients of either sex having body weight between 20 and 30 kg undergoing elective surgeries were randomly allocated to PLMA of either size 2 or 2½. Standardized anesthetic technique with propofol, sevoflurane, vecuronium bromide, nitrous oxide was used in all patients. Parameters such as number of attempts, time to achieve an effective airway, hemodynamic parameters, drain tube test, oropharyngeal leak pressure (OPL), gastric tube placement, and postoperative adverse events were noted. Statistical analysis by Kolmogorov-Smirnov analysis, Mann-Whitney U-test, Student's t-test, Wilk's lambda test and power analysis was done.There were no significant differences in demographic variables, ease of insertion and ventilation, number of insertion attempts, hemodynamics, and postoperative complications. OPLs were slightly higher in PLMA size 2½ (27.38 ± 6.36 vs. 22.62 ± 2.85 cm H2O, respectively; P = 0.001) than size 2.Both PLMA size 2 and 2½ provided adequate seal pressures that would allow positive pressure ventilation in healthy children. Thus PLMA of either size 2 or 2½ can be used as a reliable airway device in children weighing 20-30 kg.

VSpinal anesthesia in infants and children: A one year prospective audit.
p2565
aVSpinal anesthesia though gaining popularity in children, the misconceptions regarding its safety and feasibility can be better known with greater use and experience. The objective of this study was to evaluate the success rate, complications and hemodynamic stability related to pediatric spinal anesthesia.In this 1-year prospective study, 102 pediatric patients aged 6 months to 14 years undergoing infraumbilical and lower extremity surgery were included. Spinal anesthesia was administered using hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg (for child < 5 kg), 0.4 mg/kg (for 5-15 kg), 0.3 mg/kg (for >15 kg) in L4-L5 space under all aseptic precautions after sedation. Demographic data, vital parameters, supplemental sedation, number of attempts for lumbar puncture, sensory-motor block characteristics, and complications were noted.Spinal anesthesia was successful in 98 (97.1%) patients. Remaining 4 (3.9%) were failures and were given general anesthesia. Lumbar puncture was successful in first attempt (60 [58.82%]) or 2(nd) attempt (42 [41.18%]). There was no significant change in vital parameters. Mean peak sensory level was T 6.35 ± 1.20 (T4-T8). Mean sensory level at the end of surgery was T 8.11 ± 1.42 (T6-T10). Modified Bromage score was 3 in 98 (96.08%) patients. Sensory and motor block recovery was complete in all patients. Mean time to two segment regression was 43.97 ± 10.72 (30-70) min. Mean time to return Bromage score to 0 was 111.95 ± 20.54 (70-160). Mean duration of surgery was 52.5 ± 16.056 (25-95) min. Incidence of complications was minimal with hypotension occurring in 2 (2%) and shivering in 3 (2.9%) patients.Pediatric spinal anesthesia is a safe and effective anesthetic technique for lower abdominal and lower limb surgeries of shorter duration (<90 min) with high success rate. Owing to, its early motor recovery, it can be a preferred technique for day case surgeries in the pediatric population.

VComparison of vital capacity induction with sevoflurane to intravenous induction with propofol in adult patients.
p2568
aVVarious techniques exist for gaseous induction in adults. Vital capacity induction (VCI) is a special technique for gaseous induction of anesthesia.We compared the two methods for time of induction, vital parameters at induction, and suitability for laryngeal mask insertion and its effects, if any on the emergence and postoperative cognitive function tests.A total of 60 adult American Society of Anesthesiologists grades I and II gynecological patients were randomly allocated into two groups of 30 each.Group "S" received VCI with 8% sevoflurane in 8 l/min oxygen and group "P" received intravenous induction with propofol after premedication. Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was inserted and anesthesia maintained with oxygen, nitrous oxide, and sevoflurane in both groups. Induction time, corresponding entropy, vital parameters, and emergence time were noted. Postoperative cognitive and psychomotor functions were noted with P-deletion test, digit symbol substitution test, and finger nose test.Unpaired t-test and Fisher exact test.Time for induction was 61 ± 32 s and 31 ± 10.8 s for VCI (group S) and propofol (group P), respectively. The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.001). About 70% patients in VCI had excellent conditions for LMA insertion when compared with 76% in propofol group (P = 0.3855). The incidence of airway complications, emergence times, and recovery of postoperative cognitive functions was not significantly different in both groups.VCI provides an induction and recovery comparable to propofol induction.

Sedation was titrated to Ramsay sedation score (RSS) of 3. Patients' mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), saturation peripheral pulse, duration of sedation and need for intraoperative rescue sedation/analgesic were recorded and compared. Satisfaction of patients (using a 1-7 point Likert verbal rating scale) and readiness for discharge towards (time to Aldrete score of 10) were also determined.Group KM had significant rise in HR (20-25%) and MAP (25-30%) from 30 min after the bolus dose given until the end of the surgery in contrast to Group FPM. The target sedation level (RSS \u2265 3) was higher in Group FPM (n = 23 [92%]) as compared with Group KM (n = 12 [48%]). Time until need for rescue sedation was 66.96 ± 17.19 min in FPM and 32.80 ± 8.90 min in KM group. The patient satisfaction (Likert scale) is more with the FPM group (6.12 ± 0.83 vs. 4.40 ± 1.20).We found that the combination of FPM is superior to the KM combination as per the hemodynamic changes, duration of analgesia, patients' satisfaction and efficacy of the drugs are concerned.

VRole of Clonidine as adjuvant to intrathecal bupivacaine in patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery: A randomized control study.
p2574
aVNeuraxial anesthesia greatly expands the anesthesiologist armamentarium, providing alternatives to general anesthesia, especially in the lower abdominal surgeries. Clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, has a variety of actions, including potentiation of effects of local anesthetics. This study was undertaken to assess the degree of sensory and motor block and postoperative analgesia provided by low dose (50 mcg) intrathecal clonidine admixed with bupivacaine.The aim of this study is to establish efficacy and safety of intrathecal clonidine as adjuvant to bupivacaine.The type of the study was double-blind randomized trial.Hundred patients were randomly allocated in two groups, A and B. Group A received bupivacaine 0.5%, 3 ml with placebo (normal saline 0.33 ml) and Group B, bupivacaine 0.5%, 3 ml with clonidine 50 \u03bcg (0.33 ml).Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 15.0 statistical analysis software.Mean duration of motor block was significantly higher in Group B (280.80 ± 66.88 min) as compared with Group A (183.60 ± 77.06 min). Significant difference in duration of sensory block was noted between Group B (295.20 ± 81.17 min) and Group A (190.80 ± 86.94 min). Duration of postoperative analgesia was significantly higher in Group B as compared to Group A (551.06 ± 133.64 min and 254.80 ± 84.19 min respectively). Mean visual analog scale scores at different time intervals were significantly lower in the study group (except for 4-h time interval), but the control group had better hemodynamic stability as compared with study group.The findings in this study suggested that use of clonidine 50 \u03bcg added to bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia effectively increased the duration of sensory block, duration of motor block, and duration of analgesia.

VEfficacy of intravenous midazolam versus clonidine as premedicants on bispectral index guided propofol induction of anesthesia in laparoscopic cholecystectomy: A randomized control trial.
p2577
aVMidazolam and clonidine are preferred premedicants whose effects are not restricted to the preoperative period. In addition, these premedicants significantly modulate not only the intraoperative requirements of the anesthetic agents, but also the postoperative outcome. We aim to compare the efficacy of both the agents in view of premedication, induction characteristics, hemodynamic changes and postoperative complications utilizing bispectral index (BIS) using propofol anesthesia.The type of this study was randomized control trial conducted on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Study included 105 patients of either sex aged 20-60 years. The patients were randomly allocated into three groups: Intravenous midazolam (Group 1), clonidine (Group 2), and normal saline (Group 3) (control). The initial value of BIS and Ramsay Sedation Score, dose of propofol required for induction were noted in each group and monitored for pulse rate, electrocardiograph, noninvasive blood pressure, and BIS.The requirement of propofol ranged from 40 to 150 mg. Mean requirement was maximum in Group 3 (109.43 ± 20.14 mg) and it was minimum in Group 1 (78.57 ± 22.15 mg). A significant reduction in consumption of propofol with the use of midazolam (P < 0.001) and clonidine (P < 0.001) was observed. Both premedicants partially attenuates laryngoscoy and intubation response along with reduction in the incidence of postoperative complications.Both clonidine and midazolam contributed equally in lowering propofol consumption. Reduction in the induction dosage of propofol and hemodynamic variations were also observed to be similar with the use of midazolam or clonidine as premedicants. Both provide a beneficial effect in relation to recovery and less postoperative complications. However clonidine premedication was found to be more effective in preventing post operative shivering and can be recommended in routine practice.

aVKetamine was introduced commercially in 1970 with the manufacturer's description as a "rapidly acting, nonbarbiturate general anesthetic" and a suggestion that it would be useful for short procedures. With the help of its old unique pharmacological properties and newly found beneficial clinical properties, ketamine has survived the strong winds of time, and it currently has a wide variety of clinical applications. It's newly found neuroprotective, antiinflammatory and antitumor effects, and the finding of the usefulness of low dose ketamine regimens have helped to widen the clinical application profile of ketamine. The present article attempts to review the current useful applications of ketamine in anesthesia, pain and critical care.

VLiquid ventilation.
p2583
aVHuman have lungs to breathe air and they have no gills to breath liquids like fish. When the surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the lung increases as in acute lung injury, scientists started to think about filling the lung with fluid instead of air to reduce the surface tension and facilitate ventilation. Liquid ventilation (LV) is a technique of mechanical ventilation in which the lungs are insufflated with an oxygenated perfluorochemical liquid rather than an oxygen-containing gas mixture. The use of perfluorochemicals, rather than nitrogen as the inert carrier of oxygen and carbon dioxide offers a number of advantages for the treatment of acute lung injury. In addition, there are non-respiratory applications with expanding potential including pulmonary drug delivery and radiographic imaging. It is well-known that respiratory diseases are one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit. During the past few years several new modalities of treatment have been introduced. One of them and probably the most fascinating, is of LV. Partial LV, on which much of the existing research has concentrated, requires partial filling of lungs with perfluorocarbons (PFC's) and ventilation with gas tidal volumes using conventional mechanical ventilators. Various physico-chemical properties of PFC's make them the ideal media. It results in a dramatic improvement in lung compliance and oxygenation and decline in mean airway pressure and oxygen requirements. No long-term side-effect reported.

ROC showed that cut off value of 25 achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 82.35 and 43.9 %, respectively, and a cut off value of 1,000 gave a sensitivity and specificity of 58.81 and 97.56 %, respectively. The association between RMI and disease status was not statistically significant for mucinous tumors.RMI is a reliable tool in differentiating benign from malignant adnexal masses. It is simple, easy to use and cost effective. However it's predictive accuracy was less for mucinous as compared to serous epithelial ovarian cancers. The study is limited by its small sample size.

In second trimester, women received oral mifepristone followed by repeated doses of misoprostol either by buccal or vaginal route. A comparative analysis using SPSS was done.In first trimester, success rate of medical abortion was 96 % in buccal group and 88 % in vaginal group. Nausea was the most common adverse effect which was similar in both groups. In second trimester, success rate was 96 % in buccal group and 80 % in vaginal group. A statistically higher incidence of nausea was noticed in buccal group. Patient satisfaction level was almost similar in both the groups in both trimesters.Buccal and vaginal routes of misoprostol administration have similar efficacy and patient satisfaction level for first and second trimester induced abortions. Hence, buccal route may serve as an alternative to vaginal misoprostol.

aVMaternal to child transmission (MTCT) is responsible for over 90 % of all childhood HIV infections. Lack of awareness regarding HIV and preventive practices against MTCT maybe one of the reasons behind high HIV transmission rates. In our study, we assessed the knowledge of HIV/AIDS in antenatal women, attending a tertiary care hospital in India as well as their attitude toward voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) for HIV.This was a cross-sectional descriptive study carried out from May-July 2012 using a pretested interview-based questionnaire given to 386 antenatal women after obtaining consent. Data were abstracted for knowledge of HIV, MTCT, and attitude toward VCT. Results were expressed as percentages using SPSS v.16 software.Amongst the respondents, 92.5 % had heard of HIV and in 41 % of them, the source of information was through mass media. 81 % were aware of sexual intercourse as a mode of transmission of HIV while 55 % knew that sharing sharp objects and infected blood products can spread HIV. 37.6 % of respondents were aware of MTCT and 44 % heard of antiretroviral therapy as a method of prevention of MTCT. While 68 % were willing to get tested for HIV, 18.9 % knew about the steps involved and 44 % knew where to get VCT.There exists a lack of adequate knowledge regarding HIV and preventive practices against MTCT. Health education and awareness campaigns on MTCT prevention and VCT promotion should target women in their antenatal period in order to increase acceptability and accessibility of these services.

Maternal age is increasing in developing countries as well, so we have conducted this study.This was a prospective observational study consisting of 1,263 women booked at Jehangir hospital during a period of 2 years, fulfilling inclusion criteria and consenting for the study. They were divided into two groups; women aged 35 years and above and women less than 35 years of age. Pregnancy outcomes were studied in terms of antepartum, intrapartum and postpartum complications. Neonatal outcomes were studied in terms of birth weight and NICU admissions. Data was analyzed statistically using statistical package for social sciences version 17, by applying Chi square test and Fisher exact test. A p value below 0.05 was considered significant.Women aged 35 years and above constituted 9.63 % of the total study population. Most were multigravidae. Rate of assisted conception was significantly higher among women aged 35 years and above; early pregnancy loss was also high in this group. Pre-eclampsia and abruption were significantly higher among them. Neonatal outcomes were comparable.Women with advanced maternal age are at higher risk of complications from conception till delivery and should be provided close supervision for better pregnancy outcome.

VA case of inappropriately high glycated hemoglobin.
p2605
aVHemoglobin is a tetramer formed of two alpha and two beta globin chains. On exposure to high levels of blood glucose, hemoglobin gets non-enzymatically glycated at different sites in the molecule. HbA1c is formed when glucose gets added on to the N-terminal valine residue of the beta chain of hemoglobin. The development of chronic vascular complications of diabetes such as retinopathy, nephropathy and cardiovascular disease is intimately linked to the level of glycemic control attained by the individual with diabetes. We report a case of convulsions and monoplegia admitted to emergency department, showing unusually high glycated hemoglobin but plasma glucose not as high. The patient was not a known diabetic and we could not find any of the other documented conditions that are known to elevate glycated hemoglobin to such disproportionately high levels. Screening for abnormal hemoglobins was negative in the patient. Oral hypoglycemic drug treatment over 3 months and withdrawal of other medications only marginally lowered glycated hemoglobin.

aVIn this paper, the problem of the existence, uniqueness and uniform stability of memristor-based fractional-order neural networks (MFNNs) with two different types of memductance functions is extensively investigated. Moreover, we formulate the complex-valued memristor-based fractional-order neural networks (CVMFNNs) with two different types of memductance functions and analyze the existence, uniqueness and uniform stability of such networks. By using Banach contraction principle and analysis technique, some sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the existence, uniqueness and uniform stability of the considered MFNNs and CVMFNNs with two different types of memductance functions. The analysis results establish from the theory of fractional-order differential equations with discontinuous right-hand sides. Finally, four numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

VOsseous plasma cell neoplasm of the mandible for initial diagnosis of multiple myeloma: case report and literature review.
p2614
aVPlasmocytoma of the bone represents a variance of plasma cell neoplasms, which often gives hint for systemic affection. A case of a mandibular tumor as first manifestation of multiple myeloma (MM) is presented and discussed with the literature.A 76-year old female with pain and swelling of the right lower jaw was assigned to the hospital. Radiograph showed a lytic tumor at the mandibular condyle and histological analysis gave evidence of a plasma cell tumor with positivity to CD138. In further examinations, elevated immunoglobulin levels in serum and osseous plasma cell infiltration unveiled MM. PubMed-database was searched by "multiple myeloma primary lesion jaw", "multiple myeloma primary manifestation mandible" and "multiple myeloma mandibular lesion" within the last 30 years.Together with the current case, 11 reports including 13 patients were found describing mandibular plasmocytoma as first sign for MM. Mean age was 59 years with slight female preference. Initial symptoms were mostly swelling episodes with or without pain. The main radiological presentation was a uni- or multilocular radiolucency. After a mean follow up time of 29 months (stated in 8 cases; standard deviation 50, min: 1, max: 151), 3/8 patients died and in 5/8 cases, signs of progress were seen.In rare cases, occurrence of plasmocytoma of the mandible is first sign for MM and should always lead to further investigations regarding systemic disease. Simple examinations such as panoramic X-rays can lead to early detection of MM and thereby better prognosis by earlier treatment.

The term, plexiform UA, refers to a pattern of one or more nodules of ameloblasts like cells projecting from the cystic lining into the lumen of the cyst. Here we present a case of swelling in the anterior mandible of a 25 year old male which on histological examination revealed plexiform UA, which was later treated by complete surgical excision.

aVTraditionally Trichodesma indicum has been used for its therapeutic effect in folk medicine that include anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anticancer properties. In this work, we validate the anticancer potential of the plant.To screen the shoot extracts T. indicum for their antimitotic and antiproliferative activities.The dried aerial parts of T. indicum were successively extracted with petroleum ether, successive chloroform extract (SCH), successive ethanol extract (SEE) and water. The plant extracts were subjected to study of in vitro antioxidant activity using 2,2'- diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, 2,2'- azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radical inhibition systems. The extracts were also tested for their in vitro antimitotic activity in Allium cepa root and antiproliferative activity using the yeast model and five human cell lines (MCF-7, HOP-62, MOLT-4, HCT-15 and PRO).The mitotic index for SCH and SEE was found to be 12.01 ± 1.34 and 12.99 ± 0.25 mg/mL, respectively. The IC50 value in the antiproliferative assay was found to be 30.14s-35.36 mg/mL for SCH and SEE respectively. Both SCH and SEE extracts showed significant antimitotic and antiproliferative activity when compared to the standard methothreaxate, vincreastine and adriamycin. Among the extracts, SEE showed strong inhibition against MCF-7 and MOLT-4 cell lines at concentration <30 \u03bcg/mL. Phytochemical analysis of extracts indicated the presence of \u03b2-sitosterol, gallic acid and catechin. Based on these results, it is concluded that T. indicum may be a good candidate for the treatment of a variety of cancer. Thus, its traditional use is validated.

VNootropic (medhya) effect of Bh\u0101vita \u015aa\u1e47khapu\u1e63p\u012b tablets: A clinical appraisal.
p2627
aVNootropic (medhya) potential of \u015ba\u1e45khapu\u1e63p\u012b (Convolvulus pluricaulis Choisy.) is reported in Ayurvedic literature and modern studies are now validating the same. In spite of plentiful preclinical researches already carried out during the past decades, only meager clinical efforts exploring its nootropic activity have been reported. Present clinical study is an attempt to evaluate the nootropic effect of \u015aa\u1e45khapu\u1e63p\u012b tablets.To evaluate the nootropic effect of \u015ba\u1e45khapu\u1e63p\u012b tablets prepared by three Bh\u0101van\u0101 (levigation) of its c\u016br\u1e47a (powder) with its own Svarasa (fresh juice).Thirty volunteers between the age 16 and 25 years participated in this single group pre-post study. Weschler's memory scale was adopted to collect data before (pre) and after (post) intervention period (2 months). Paired t-test was used for analyzing the data.In auditory immediate test and delayed test, 41.03% and 48% improvement was found which statistically highly significant (<0.001). In visual immediate and delayed test 32.5% and 44.87% improvement was found respectively, which shows highly significant result (<0.001).Results reveal that \u015ba\u1e45khapu\u1e63p\u012b tablet shown highly significant results in improving memory, especially in long term memory loss in younger age group.

VGastroprotective activity of reconstituted red fruit pulp concentrate of Citrullus lanatus in rats.
p2630
aVThis study was carried out to evaluate the gastroprotective potential of the aqueous fruit pulp concentrate of Citrullus lanatus citroides (CLC) on pyloric ligation and indomethacin-induced ulcer in Wistar albino rats.In indomethacin-induced ulcer model, CLC was administered in the doses of 250 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg body weight orally, tds for 5 days. The antiulcer activity was determined via observing reduction in ulcer index whereas in the pyloric ligation model, the gastroprotective effect of CLC was assessed from the alteration in volume of gastric juice, pH, free and total acidity, protein concentration in gastric juice. Further lipid peroxide (LPO), and activities of enzymic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) was also determined along with the levels of hexose, hexosamine, sialic acid, fucose in gastric mucosa.In both models, treatment with CLC caused a significant reduction in lesion index when compared to vehicle treated group, providing evidence for antiulcer capacity. In pyloric ligation model, pretreatment with CLC resulted in significant increase in pH, enzymic antioxidants, that is, SOD, CAT, with a significant decrease in volume of gastric juice, free and total acidity, protein concentration, acid output, and LPO levels respectively. The presence of the flavonoids and polyphenols may be responsible for the gastroprotective effect of CLC.The aqueous fruit pulp concentrate of CLC showed significant gastroprotective potential against pyloric ligation and indomethacin-induced ulceration in rats.

VManagement of Ano-Rectal disorders by K\u1e63\u0101ras\u016btra: A clinical report.
p2639
aVAno-rectal complaints are usually benign in origin. Most of the patients suffering with these disorders do not seek medical advice at an early stage due to embarrassment. It results in advancement of the disease and significant disturbance in the quality of life. Among the available treatment modalities of ano-rectal disorders (ARDs), K\u1e63\u0101ras\u016btra (medicated thread) appears to be the best in terms of relief and nonrecurrence.The aim of this study is to provide evidence-based data about the practical application of K\u1e63\u0101ras\u016btra (medicated thread) in the management of ARDs.An ano-rectal operation theatre was established in September 2012, in association with the Government Ayurvedic Speciality Clinic at District Hospital, Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh, to facilitate the AYUSH services in Allopathic Hospitals. Present report includes the details of ARDs treated by K\u1e63\u0101ras\u016btra (Medicated thread) method during 2012-2013. A total of 127 ano-rectal cases were operated, which included 44 cases of hemorrhoids, 40 cases of fistula-in-ano, 39 cases of fissure-in-ano and three cases of peri-anal abscess. All the cases were analyzed as per the observations, subjective and objective parameters, and follow-up was carried out for a period of 6 months.In the 127 ARDs treated, 45 patients suffering from hemorrhoids, 36 patients got complete relief, marked relief observed in 4 patients, moderate relief observed in 5 patients. In fistula-in-ano, out of 40 patients 29 patients got complete relief, marked relief was seen in 7 patients out of them 4 patients were referred to anti-tubercular treatment center, 4 patients left against medical advice. In fissure-in-ano-out of 39 patients, 32 patients got complete relief, 5 patients got marked relief, moderate relief observed in 2 patients. These results authenticate the effectiveness of K\u1e63\u0101ras\u016btra, no adverse effects or recurrence observed in any case.ARDs are efficiently treated by K\u1e63\u0101ras\u016btra technique with prompt symptomatic resolution and prevention of recurrence and complications.

VAnalgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of aqueous extract of leaves of Pentatropis capensis Linn. f. (Bullock).
p2645
aVHerbal analgesic and anti-inflammatory remedies are preferred much because of lesser side effects and also a lower tendency for habit formation. Pentatropis capensis is such an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug which is popular among folklore remedies for various injuries and inflammatory problems. It is called by the name of K\u0101kan\u0101sik\u0101 in Ayurvedic works. This study was designed to investigate the analgesic, and anti-inflammatory effects of aqueous extract of P. capensis leaves (AEPC) in rats.AEPC was assessed for Analgesic effect through radiant heat tail-flick model and anti-inflammatory effect through carrageenan-induced paw edema model on Wistar strain of albino rats.Pentatropis capensis leaves aqueous extract showed significant (P < 0.001) increase in the duration of latency of tail flick response at the dose levels of 450 mg/kg, p.o. as compared to the control group. Similarly, the similar dose level produced significant (P < 0.01) anti-inflammatory effect against acute paw edema after 3 h of carrageenan induction when compared to the control group.The observed effects were comparable with the standard drug-treated group thus demonstrating effective central analgesic and acute anti-inflammatory potentials of the P. capensis leaves aqueous extract and the observations substantiate its folklore use as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory.

VEmergence of multidrug resistant enterococci at a tertiary care centre.
p2648
aVEnterococci have assumed great clinical importance because of their increasing resistance to various antimicrobial agents. Thus, knowledge about the antibiogram of these multidrug resistant isolates is of utmost importance in formulating an effective antibiotic policy to treat these infections and reducing the morbidity and mortality. Aim of this study was to assess the antimicrobial resistance pattern of enterococci and determine the prevalence of multidrug resistance among them.This cross sectional study was carried out from August 2011 to February 2014, in which 200 non-repetitive clinical isolates of enterococci were included. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by disc diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of gentamicin, streptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid was determined by E-test method.The prevalence of multidrug resistance among enterococcal isolates was found to be 63%. Varying levels of resistance was seen to various antibiotics. Most of the isolates were resistant to penicillin (95%), ampicillin (95%) and cotrimoxazole (90%). High level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR) and glycopeptide resistance was seen in 39% and 14% isolates respectively. Only 4 isolates (2%) were found to be resistant to linezolid.The prevalence of multidrug resistance among enterococci was found to be 63%, the resistance being more common in Enterococcus faecium as compared to Enterococcus faecalis. The study highlights the emergence and increased prevalence of multidrug resistant enterococci which pose a serious therapeutic challenge.

VPsychomotor functions at various weeks of chronic renal failure in rats.
p2651
aVIn chronic renal failure there is a gradual retention of substances in the tissues and body fluids, called as uremic retention toxins, which can bring about a number of biochemical activities in the body. Chronic renal insufficiency also leads to progressive behavioural conflict. Uremic toxins can affect both the central and the peripheral nervous system. Uremic encephalopathy is also associated with problems in cognition and memory. To study the psychomotor functional disorders in rats with progressive chronic renal failure surgical nephrectomy was done by resection method. The animals were grouped into two control groups, Sham control (SC) and normal control (NC) and two uremic groups, moderate uremia (GM) and severe uremia (GS). Psychomotor analysis was done by passive avoidance and open field in these animals at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks. After the incubation period, the nephrectomised groups (GM and GS) showed significant changes in exploratory, locomotor and emotional behaviour when compared to the controls (NC and SC). Psychomotor changes involve poor cognition, reduced memory, reduced locomotor activity and decreased exploratory drive and emotional disturbance like increased fear during the initial stages. During the later stages a restless behaviour was noticed, associated with diminished fear.

VFacial translocation approach for management of invasive sinonasal aspergillosis.
p2654
aVAspergillosis is an uncommon fungal disease seen commonly in paranasal sinuses. It may be of noninvasive variety which is restricted to paranasal sinuses seen in healthy and immunocompetent hosts or may present as invasive form seen in immunocompromised hosts especially in diabetics and patients under long term immunosuppressant therapy. Along with paranasal sinuses invasive forms may encroach upon surrounding adjacent structures involving the orbit and extend intracranially. Orbital and intracranial involvement have a high mortality rate. Early diagnosis of the lesion and prompt aggressive management is important for better prognosis. Aggressive treatment includes surgical debulking and medical management mainly with systemic amphotericin B and other azoles. In orbito-cranial involvement, due to limited access to cranial base, it becomes difficult to surgically debulk the lesion with safety to surrounding important structures. Facial translocation approach gives adequate access to paranasal sinuses, orbit and anterior cranial base. Reported here are two cases of invasive cranio-orbito-nasal aspergillosis treated with facial translocation approach.

Death occurred in 12 patients, four patients had disease recurrence and 17 patients lost to follow up. QOL in five domains was improved, there was significant improvement in pain scores [mean difference (-)17.94], overall activity of the patient was significantly improved (-13.46), recreational activities were also significantly improved (-8.33) and mental status of patient which included the mood and anxiety level were also significantly improved (-13.71 and -11.53) respectively. In seven domains which included the appearance of the patient (32.05), swallowing (16.41), chewing (24.35), speech (29.48), shoulder pain and discomfort (6.92), taste (35.12) and saliva production scores (20.51) were significantly worse.By our study we can strongly recommend that oral tongue cancers if diagnosed at early stages and without any neck node (T1-2N0M0) can be easily managed without compromising the QOL of the patients significantly.

aVStudy on the phase transition characteristics is an important parameter in extrusion processing. The influence of Moisture Content (MC), particle size and level of cereal-pulse blend on the glass transition (Tg) and melt (Tm) temperatures of a ready to eat cereal-pulse formulation was determined. All samples were moisture conditioned in a 9 to 27 % with 3 % interval. Tg and Tm were measured by phase transition analyser (PTA). A substantial decrease in Tg and Tm was observed as moisture content level increased from 9 to 27 %. However Tg and Tm values could not be clearly defined below 9 % moisture content and above 27 % moisture content. The Tg and Tm values of the cereal-pulse formulation were found to be increased with increasing pulse composition (5 to 30 % with 5 % interval). Increase in particle size (150, 180, 212, 300, 425 and 500 \u03bc) exhibited significant increase effect on Tg while less significant effect on Tm. This may be due to crystalline regions which play a role in cross linking amorphous regions of the polymeric network and thus suppress the mobility of amorphous regions. The observed differences in Tg and Tm induced by the moisture content, concentration of Bengal gram and particle size will be useful in simulation and optimization of barrel temperature set during extrusion processing.

aVThe aim of this study is to observe rise in haematological parameters after treatment with iron sucrose in antenatal patients with moderate anemia with period of gestation 32 to 35 weeks. The study included 45 antenatal patients with period of gestation from 32 to 35 weeks having iron deficiency anemia with haemoglobin levels 7-9 g% and serum ferritin levels less than 12 ng/mL. Intravenous iron sucrose was given in the dose of 200 mg on alternate days, according to the calculated dose. The mean haemoglobin and red blood cell indices were compared on days 7, 14, 21, 28 and at the time of delivery from the baseline value. There was a statistically significant rise in haemoglobin value from baseline on days 14, 21, 28 as well as at the time of delivery (p value <0.0001). The mean rise in haemoglobin values was 0.56 g% on day 14, 1.44 g% on day 21 and 2.0 g% on day 28. At the time of delivery, mean haemoglobin was 11.24 g%. After 28 days of treatment, there was a statistically significant rise in the levels of serum ferritin from 10.33 ± 3.8 ng/mL to 36.89 ± 5.7 ng/mL. Thus, earlier response achieved by iron sucrose can be utilised in the patients presenting at an advanced period of gestation with iron deficiency anemia.

VMolecular, Physiological and Phenotypic Characterization of Paracoccus denitrificans ATCC 19367 Mutant Strain P-87 Producing Improved Coenzyme Q10.
p2674
aVCoenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a blockbuster nutraceutical molecule which is often used as an oral supplement in the supportive therapy for cardiovascular diseases, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. It is commercially produced by fermentation process, hence constructing the high yielding CoQ10 producing strains is a pre-requisite for cost effective production. Paracoccus denitrificans ATCC 19367, a biochemically versatile organism was selected to carry out the studies on CoQ10 yield improvement. The wild type strain was subjected to iterative rounds of mutagenesis using gamma rays and NTG, followed by selection on various inhibitors like CoQ10 structural analogues and antibiotics. The screening of mutants were carried out using cane molasses based optimized medium with feeding strategies at shake flask level. In the course of study, the mutant P-87 having marked resistance to gentamicin showed 1.25-fold improvements in specific CoQ10 content which was highest among all tested mutant strains. P-87 was phenotypically differentiated from the wild type strain on the basis of carbohydrate assimilation and FAME profile. Molecular differentiation technique based on AFLP profile showed intra specific polymorphism between wild type strain and P-87. This study demonstrated the beneficial outcome of induced mutations leading to gentamicin resistance for improvement of CoQ10 production in P. denitrificans mutant strain P-87. To investigate the cause of gentamicin resistance, rpIF gene from P-87 and wild type was sequenced. No mutations were detected on the rpIF partial sequence of P-87; hence gentamicin resistance in P-87 could not be conferred with rpIF gene. However, detecting the mutations responsible for gentamicin resistance in P-87 and correlating its role in CoQ10 overproduction is essential. Although only 1.25-fold improvement in specific CoQ10 content was achieved through mutant P-87, this mutant showed very interesting characteristic, differentiating it from its wild type parent strain P. denitrificans ATCC 19367, which are presented in this paper.

aVAcinetobacter baumannii is an important emerging cause for extensively-drug resistant (XDR) hospital associated infections (HAIs) in pediatric intensive care units (PICU). The study was done to evaluate the risk factors, outcome, antibiotic sensitivity pattern, and predictors of mortality in critically ill children with XDR A. baumannii infection.Retrospective case control study, done in the PICU of a tertiary care pediatric hospital of India from April 2010 to March 2012.Eighty-five children who developed XDR A. baumannii infection matched to 170 controls. Majority (76%) of the organisms were isolated from endotracheal lavage. The mortality rate was 28.2% (24/85). The factors found to be significantly associated with A. baumannii infection were prior use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, major surgeries done, prolonged PICU stay, use of central venous catheters, and mechanical ventilation. The predictors of mortality associated with A. baumannii infection were acute kidney injury, presence of septic shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Colistin found to be the single most effective drug against XDR A. baumannii infection.XDR A. baumannii infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality in critically ill children. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial. Implementation of infection control practices and rational use of antibiotics are required to control such infections.

aVThrombocytopenia due to hypersplenism precludes percutaneous liver biopsy in many cases of chronic liver disease (CLD). The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of propranolol in correcting platelet counts (>100,000/mm(3)) to ensure percutaneous liver biopsy in children with CLD.From January 2005 to December 2012, 51 consecutive children (mean age 11.5 ± 3.0 years, 34 boys) with CLD who needed liver biopsy but could not be done due to hypersplenism-related thrombocytopenia (platelets <100,000/mm(3) and/or total leukocyte counts <4,000/mm(3) with splenomegaly) were recruited and given a 4-week trial of long-acting propranolol (1.5-2 mg/kg/day). Hemodynamic parameters and splenic artery hemodynamics by Doppler ultrasound were recorded before and after the propranolol trial. Response to therapy was defined as improvement of platelet counts to \u226510(5)/mm(3).Thirty-two (62.7%) children responded to propranolol therapy and their mean platelet counts increased from 57.5 ± 13.0 × 10(3) to 140.7 ± 43.3 × 10(3)/mm(3), p = 0.0001. Liver biopsy could be done in 29. While comparing responders with non-responders, baseline spleen size (7.4 ± 3.3 vs. 12.7 ± 4.5 cm, p = 0.0001) and platelet counts (57.5 ± 13.0 × 10(3) vs. 39.5 ± 14.5 × 10(3), p = 0.0001) were found to be significant. ROC curve suggested a cut-off value of \u22648.5 cm of spleen and \u226553,000 platelets as predictors of response. With propranolol, mean arterial pressure and spleen size reduced (p < 0.05) and splenic artery resistance increased significantly (p = 0.005) in responders.Propranolol corrects thrombocytopenia and makes liver biopsy possible in almost two-thirds of cases by reducing splenic sequestration through splenic artery vasoconstriction. The baseline spleen size and platelet counts determine the effectiveness of therapy. A trial of \u03b2-blocker is worth carrying out in cases where liver biopsy is contraindicated due to hypersplenism-related thrombocytopenia.

Their complete blood counts and CD4 counts were done. Descriptive statistics was done by two methods correlating TLC alone with CD4 and the other using combined marker of TLC and Hb with CD4 count.Total lymphocyte count alone did not correlate well with CD4 counts (r = 0.13; p = 0.065). Sensitivity of TLC < 1200 /mm3 to predict CD4 < 200 /mm3 was low (23.27%) and the sensitivity of the combined marker (TLC + Hb) increased with higher Hb cut-offs.Adding Hb to TLC markedly improved the sensitivity of the marker to predict CD4 count < 200/mm3. We also recommend a trade-off Hb cut-off of 10.5 g/dL for optimum sensitivity and specificity in this population subset.

Tight glycemic control with glycosylated haemoglobin of <7 gms% is recommended as a routine and < 6.5 gms% is recommended for young and newly diagnosed diabetics. Treatment goal aims at achieving near normal blood glucose level, and directed at management of other co morbid conditions such as obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia. Oral hypoglycemic agents are the preferred drugs, alone or in combination. Preference for glitazones is declining due to the increasing evidences of associated adverse events. Gliptins appear as promising agents with lesser tendency to cause hypoglycemia, but their long term safety and efficacy is yet to be established. We emphasize the role of preventive measures in prediabetics and in established DM, treatment should be individualized and customized to minimize hypoglycemic effects and to retain quality of life.

Ectopic expression of C-terminal phospho-mutants of PTEN, in PTEN deficient human glioblastoma cells, U87MG, resulted in reduced viability and DNA repair after etoposide induced DNA damage compared to cells expressing wild type PTEN. Also, after etoposide treatment phosphorylation of PTEN increased at C-terminal serine 380 and threonine 382/383 residues in PTEN positive HEK293T cells and wild type PTEN transfected U87MG cells. One-step further, DNA damage induced phosphorylation of PTEN was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of total PTEN from cellular extract followed by immunobloting with phospho-specific PTEN antibodies. Additionally, phospho-PTEN translocated to nucleus after etoposide treatment as revealed by indirect immunolabeling. Further, phosphorylation dependent nuclear foci formation of PTEN was observed after ionizing radiation or etoposide treatment which colocalized with \u03b3H2AX. Additionally, etoposide induced \u03b3H2AX, Mre11 and Ku70 foci persisted for a longer period of times in U87MG cells after ectopic expression of PTEN C-terminal phospho-mutant constructs compared to wild type PTEN expressing cells. Thus, our findings strongly suggest that DNA damage induced phosphorylation of C-terminal STT motif of PTEN is necessary for DNA repair.

VEmerging importance of mismatch repair components including UvrD helicase and their cross-talk with the development of drug resistance in malaria parasite.
p2696
aVHuman malaria is an important parasitic infection responsible for a significant number of deaths worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The recent scenario has worsened mainly because of the emergence of drug-resistant malaria parasites having the potential to spread across the world. Drug-resistant parasites possess a defective mismatch repair (MMR); therefore, it is essential to explore its mechanism in detail to determine the underlying cause. Recently, artemisinin-resistant parasites have been reported to exhibit nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in MMR pathways such as MutL homolog (MLH) and UvrD. Plasmodium falciparum MLH is an endonuclease required to restore the defective MMR in drug-resistant W2 strain of P. falciparum. Although the role of helicases in eukaryotic MMR has been questioned, the identification and characterization of the UvrD helicase and their cross-talk with MLH in P. falciparum suggests the possible involvement of UvrD in MMR. A comparative genome-wide analysis revealed the presence of the UvrD helicase in Plasmodium species, while it is absent in human host. Therefore, PfUvrD may emerge as a suitable drug target to control malaria. This review study is focused on recent developments in MMR biochemistry, emerging importance of the UvrD helicase, possibility of its involvement in MMR and the emerging cross-talk between MMR components and drug resistance in malaria parasite.

aVRecipients of renal transplant are at increased risk of developing various malignancies, especially post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and skin cancers. Neuroendocrine tumours (NET) of the gastrointestinal tract have not been reported in this setting. Here we describe the case of a 75-year-old male who had undergone renal transplant 8 years back and now presented with significant weight loss and backache, clinically suspected as PTLD. (18)F-Fluordeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) showed hypermetabolic lesions in the liver and rectum, raising the suspicion of PTLD. However, biopsy from the liver lesion showed poorly differentiated NET. (68)Ga-labelled [1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid]-1-NaI(3)-octreotide ((68)Ga-DOTANOC) PET-CT was then done, which confirmed the primary lesion in the rectum with liver metastases.

We report a case of 60 year old man who presented with 2 months history of rapidly growing thyroid enlargement with no obstructive features and preliminary diagnosis of spindle cell lesion of thyroid was made with cytological examination. He underwent total thyroidectomy and histological examination revealed spindle cell sarcoma of thyroid confirmed by immunohistochemical reactions. He was subjected to adjuvant chemoradiotherapy and is on follow up. Sarcoma of thyroid is rarely encountered in routine practice and is diagnosed by microscopic evaluation and immunohistochemical staining which determines the cellular origin and histologic type of tumor . Sarcoma thyroid is best managed with surgery and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy according to the grade of the lesion. In addition overall prognosis in thyroid sarcoma is poor due to late presentation and aggressive nature of the tumour.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Cervical spine & MR Angiography showed a 7.4\u2009×\u20094.6 cm expansile lesion involving transverse process of C5-C7 vertebrae. As the tumour was found to be deep to the phrenic nerve & brachial plexus, a dual approach was used, anteriorly via neck incision and posteriorly via the spine. The tumour was resected & iliac crest grafted along with stabilization of the cervical spine. Patient is disease free and the cervical spine stabilized with normal movements at two and half years follow up. We need to consider tumour arising from the vertebra as a differential diagnosis for any deep seated hard neck swelling in the supraclavicular region.

aVMaintaining quality of life (QOL) is one of the important aims of cancer treatment. Quality of life of a cancer patient is affected by various factors, which may be disease related, patient related, or treatment related. To study changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) brought about by treatment of rectal cancer and factors affecting the changes using Malayalam translation of FACT-C (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal) Questionnaire. Also to detect the minimally important clinical changes (MICC) in health-related quality of life of patients with carcinoma rectum, who have undergone surgery. Forty-five patients diagnosed with carcinoma rectum, who have undergone curative surgery, were studied. HRQOL was assessed at baseline 2 weeks after surgery and 3 months after surgery. The changes in scores were correlated with various demographic factors like age, sex, marital status, number of children, number of married children, and education and occupation of the patient and spouse. Also the treatment-related factors like presence of stoma, presence of morbidity, previous treatment, stage of disease, and administration of chemotherapy before and after surgery were correlated. All the subscales of FACT-C tool, except emotional well-being, were significantly reduced 2 weeks after surgery and increased slightly above pre-treatment level 3 months after surgery. The Chronbach \u03b1 values were 0.88, 0.89 and 0.86 on three occasions, respectively, establishing internal validity of the test. Baseline HRQOL scores were better in males compared to females. Among the various subscales, the drops in SWB, FWB, FACT-G, total Score and TOI were significant (P\u2009<\u2009.05).There were no significant differences in scores between patients who have undergone open surgery and minimally invasive surgery or patients who had permanent colostomy versus no colostomy. The HRQOL scores after surgery reduced 2 weeks after surgery and improved above pre-surgical levels 3 months after surgery. The approach of surgery (minimally invasive versus open) or presence or absence of permanent colostomy didn't make any significant change in HRQOL. But since the sample size of the study was small, we need further larger studies to arrive at definite conclusions.

These obstacles may be physical, technical, or psychosocial barriers in the form of perceptions and attitudes related to software incompatibilities, patient privacy, and interference with the patient-practitioner relationship. The objectives of the study are to assess the perceptions of Indian dental students of one school toward the usefulness of digital technologies in improving dental practice; their willingness to use digital and electronic technologies; the perceived obstacles to the use of digital and electronic technologies in dental care setups; and their attitudes toward Internet privacy issues.The study population consisted of 186 final year undergraduate dental students from the A. B. Shetty Memorial institute of Dental Sciences, Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, Mangalore, India. Survey data were analyzed descriptively .Most students indicated that information technology enhances patient satisfaction, the quality of dental record, diagnosis, treatment planning, and doctor-doctor communication. Cost of equipment and need for technical training were regarded as major obstacles by substantial proportions of respondents.Most dental students at our school feel that the information technology will support their decision making in diagnoses and devising effective treatment plans, which in turn increase patient satisfaction and quality of care. Students also perceived that lack of technical knowledge and the high cost of implementation are major barriers to developing information technology in India.

aVLifelong learning is a skill that must be acquired by medical graduates and proposes that students take the responsibility for learning process. The present study was carried out to measure readiness for self-directed learning among fifth semester MBBS studentsin a tertiary care teaching hospital.Readiness assessment was carried out among 87 fifth semester MBBS students using Fishers' 40-item self-directed learning readiness score (SDLRS) instrument after taking informed written consent. A total of 40 items were classified into three domains: Self-management (9 items), desire for learning (16 items) and self-control (15 items). Institute scientific society and ethical committee clearance was obtained. The data were entered and analyzed using IBM-SPSS version 21. Chi-square test was used to elicit relationship between readiness assessment and gender, presence of a physician in family and area of residence.Out of 87 students, 64 (73.5%) students consented to be assessed for readiness toward self-directed learning. The mean SDLRS score was 140.4 ± 24.4, with 19 students (30%) scoring more than 150 indicating high readiness.The mean scores in the three domains of self-management, desire for learning and self-control were 38.8 ± 9.8, 47.3 ± 6.9 and 54.3 ± 10.4, respectively. Males had a higher readiness for self-directed learning than females (P = 0.045).Self-directed learning scores were lower among our MBBS students than reported elsewhere in the literature.

VIntroduction of Mini-CEX in undergraduate dental education in India.
p2737
aVSome assessment methods of clinical learners have limitations so that students might not reflect their performance in actual clinical situations. Educational research has so far not yielded a single 'gold-standard' performance assessment tool. Mini-CEX (clinical evaluation exercise) is an instrument intended for work-based assessment of actual clinical performance, including a range of skills like communication and humanistic qualities. It involves direct observation of real patient encounters followed by one-on-one structured feedback sessions between assessors and the trainees. Mini-CEX has already found wide acceptance in medical education but is largely untested in dental education.Twelve dental undergraduate students underwent one mini-CEX encounter each. Four teachers performed the roles of assessors, directly observing the students and rating their performance using the standardized mini-CEX rating form. A systematic feedback session then took place, following which students' and teachers' perception of the mini-CEX was sought through structured questionnaires.Almost all students appreciated that their communication skills were assessed, but some felt that the presence of a teacher was intimidating. They felt that the constructive feedback helped them reinforce the skills that they did well. The assessors found planning for mini-CEX time consuming and also felt that that their presence had an impact on the students' performance. However, teachers reported that the mini-CEX allows them to assess students' professionalism and communication skills, which are important in dentistry.Data from this pilot study supports the use of mini-CES in dental education, but still the need for wider studies remains. It also explains the ways in which undergraduate dental students and teachers find the mini-CEX useful and how it could be improved and used more effectively.

VSustained virological response rates to antiviral therapy in genotype 1 and 3 chronic hepatitis C patients: a study from north India.
p2746
aVIn India, both genotype 3 and 1 are predominant genotypes in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). However, there is scanty data on sustained viral response (SVR) rate with conventionally recommended dual therapy with PEG-IFN and ribavirin.In this retrospective study, consecutive patients of CHC of genotypes 1 and 3, attending the single unit of Gastroenterology of our hospital, who received PEG-IFN and ribavirin therapy, were included. Patients who had co-infection with HIV or HBV were excluded.A total of 114 patients were included in the study median age 44 (15-72) years, 79% males. Most common presentation was with chronic hepatitis, while 10 (9%) patients had compensated cirrhosis. Nine (8%) patients had associated diabetes, 16 (14%) patients gave history of significant alcohol abuse. The median baseline HCV RNA level was 3.0 × 10(5) (1.7 × 10(3)-1.8 × 10(7)) IU/mL. The most common genotype was 3 (75%) followed by genotype 1 (25%). 70% patients received PegIFN-\u03b12a (median dose 180 MIU/wk) and 30% patients received PegIFN-\u03b12b (median dose 80 MIU/wk). The median ribavirin dose was 800 (range 800-1200) mg. SVR in genotype 1 was 64% (18/28) while SVR in genotype 3 was 73% (63/86). The factors predicting SVR on univariate analysis were a lower baseline HCV RNA level (less than 3.0 × 10(5)), higher hemoglobin level > 11.8 g/dl, and achievement of rapid virological response (RVR), early virological response (EVR) and end of treatment response (ETR). In multivariate analysis the only baseline factor found independently correlating with SVR was low HCV RNA level (<3.0 × 10(5) IU/mL) (P = 0.003).In north India, HCV genotype 3 has a SVR rate of 73%, which is comparable to genotype 1 with SVR rate of 64% when treated with PEG-IFN and ribavirin therapy. A baseline HCV RNA level lower than 3.0 × 10(5) best predicts SVR in addition to achievement of RVR, EVR or ETR.

p2759
aVChronic microangiopathy of portal venules results in idiopathic non-cirrhotic intrahepatic portal hypertension (NCIPH). Recent data suggest a role for vasoactive factors of portal venous origin in the pathogenesis of this 'pure' vasculopathy of the liver. Enteropathies (often silent), are an important 'driver' of this disease. NCIPH is under-recognized and often mis-labeled as cryptogenic cirrhosis. Liver biopsy is needed to prove the diagnosis of NCIPH. In these patients, with advancing disease and increased porto-systemic shunting, the portal venous vasoactive factors bypass the liver filter and contribute to the development of pulmonary vascular endothelial disorders-porto-pulmonary hypertension and hepato-pulmonary syndrome as well as mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis. Prognosis in NCIPH patients is determined by presence, recognition and management of associated disorders. With better understanding of the pathogenesis of NCIPH, newer treatment options are being explored. Imbalance in ADAMTS 13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13): vWF (von-Willebrand factor) ratio is documented in NCIPH patients and may have a pathogenic role. Therapeutic interventions to correct this imbalance may prove to be important in the management of NCIPH.

VAccuracy of Rapid Point-of-Care Diagnostic Tests for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen-A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
p2762
aVRapid point-of-care tests provide plausible diagnostic strategy for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in low resource areas. However, their utility depends upon their overall performance. Our objective was to meta-analyze the diagnostic accuracy of rapid point-of-care tests for HBsAg.Literature search was done with the help of a metasearch engine Mett\u0101, a query interface for retrieving articles from five leading medical databases. Studies that employed rapid point-of-care tests for detection of HBsAg and compared the results with reference test were included. Two reviewers performed quality assessment of the studies and extracted data for estimating test accuracy. Twenty-seven studies were meta-analyzed and stratified by multiple parameters.Twenty-seven studies had evaluated 49 test brands and generated 76 data points. Sensitivity of individual tests varied widely and were heterogeneous (range 43.5%-99.8%); while specificity estimates were more robust and close to 100% (range 90%-100%). Overall pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR), negative LR and diagnostic odds ratio for all tests were 97.1% (95% CI, 96.1%-97.9%), 99.9% (CI, 99.8%-100%), 118.4 (CI, 84.7-165.5), 0.032 (CI, 0.023-0.045) and 4094.7 (CI, 2504.1-6600.8) respectively. This suggested high pooled accuracy for all studies. We found substantial heterogeneity between studies. Three factors (study location, reference standard and study score) appeared most strongly associated with test estimates and observed heterogeneity. The Determine test showed consistency in performance in studies done across developed and developing countries and the Determine and the BinaxNOW tests had significantly higher estimates than pooled estimates of remaining tests. Tests revealed analytical sensitivity of 4 IU/ml against manufacturer's claim of 0.5 IU/ml; reduced sensitivity with HBsAg mutants and poor performance in seroconversion panels.Tests with better analytical sensitivity need to be developed and their feasibility and outcomes in various clinical settings need to be addressed.

aVEighty percent (80%) of patients with Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) respond to a combination of prednisolone and Azathioprine (AZA). Choice of treatment is limited for those who do not respond to this standard therapy. We evaluated the role of Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as a second line therapy in AIH.A retrospective observational study was carried out on all patients who received MMF for AIH.Twenty out of 117 patients with AIH received MMF due to AZA intolerance (18 patients) or refractory disease (2 patients). Median age of the study patients was 56 (18-79) years, Male, n = 3 (15%) and Female, n = 18 (85%). After a median follow-up period of 47 (5-83) months, 14 (73.6%) patients were still on MMF with biochemical remission, including 4 out of 5 patients with cirrhosis. One patient was lost to follow-up. Three patients were intolerant of MMF due to adverse events, and two had disease refractory to MMF. Both these patients with refractory disease to MMF were initially unresponsive to AZA therapy.MMF is a safe second line agent in patients with autoimmune hepatitis including those with cirrhosis.

aVProphylaxis with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and nucleoside analogs can prevent hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after liver transplant (LT).To determine the efficacy and cost of maintaining immunoprophylaxis with HBIG and hyperimmune plasma (HIP) for 6 months after LT.The study included 22 HBV related LT recipients who were on entecavir and either HBIG or HIP for 6 months. Post transplant HBIG or HIP dose and cost incurred towards prophylaxis were noted. The cost of 200 IU of HBIG at the time of study was Rs 8250/- (US Dollars 135) and that of 2000 IU of HIP was Rs 8000/- (USD 130.7). The loading and maintenance costs at end of 6 months were compared between the two groups. Response to HBIG and HIP was assessed by checking for HBsAg reactivity, anti HBs titer response and HBV DNA viral load.Median and range, Kruskal Wallis (KW) sign rank Sum Test and Correlation Coefficient (r2) was used for analysis.Thirteen recipients received HBIG and 9 recipients HIP. The anti HBs response to HIP was significantly high compared to HBIG (KW Sign rank Sum test P < 0.05); titers remained high until the study period. Between 8 and 30 days, the titer achieved by both HBIG and HIP was similar (KW Sign rank Sum test not significant). Despite low anti HBs titer of <100 IU/L, none of the recipients on HBIG had HBsAg reactivity while 3 on HIP had transient HBsAg positivity. The total cost with HBIG was 13.9 times the cost of HIP.HIP immunoprophylaxis in combination with entecavir achieves a high anti HBs titer at a significant low cost during anhepatic and loading phase. HBV reactivation rates with HBIG and HIP is low despite low anti HBs titer.

VFipronil induced oxidative stress in kidney and brain of mice: protective effect of vitamin E and vitamin C.
p2774
aVFipronil is a relatively new insecticide of the phenpyrazole group. Fipronil-induced effects on antioxidant system and oxidative stress biomarkers are yet to be studied in vivo. The present study was undertaken to evaluate fipronil-induced alterations in the blood biochemical markers and tissue antioxidant enzymes after oral exposure in mice and to explore possible protective effect of pre-treatment of antioxidant vitamins against these alterations. Mice were divided into eight groups containing control, test and amelioration groups. Mice in the test groups were exposed to different doses of fipronil, i.e., 2.5, 5 and 10\u2009mg/kg bw, respectively for 28 days. Mice in the amelioration groups were treated with vitamin E or vitamin C (each at 100\u2009mg/kg) 2\u2009h prior to high dose (10\u2009mg/kg) of fipronil. Fipronil exposure at three doses caused significant increase in the blood biochemical markers, lipid peroxidation and prominent histopathological alterations; while level of antioxidant enzymes was severely decreased both in kidney and brain tissues. Prior administration of vitamin E or vitamin C in the fipronil exposed mice led to decrease in lipid peroxidation and significant increase in activities of antioxidants, viz., glutathione, total thiol, superoxide dismutase and catalase. Vitamin E and vitamin C administration in fipronil exposed mice also improved histological architecture of the kidney and brain when compared with fipronil alone treated groups. Thus, results of the present study demonstrated that in vivo fipronil exposure induces oxidative stress and pre-treatment with vitamin E or C can protect mice against this oxidative insult.

VAssessing Institutional Ethics Committees in India Using the IRB-RAT.
p2777
aVInstitutional ethics committees (IECs) are currently still in their infancy in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs), which may have important implications with regard to the oversight of the protection of human participants. Understanding how these IECs currently function is a critical first step in helping LMICs build infrastructures that support the protection of research participants and improve the scientific quality of health research worldwide. We assessed the functioning of the IECs at two medical colleges in Gujarat, India, by administering the Institutional Review Board Researcher's Assessment Tool (IRB-RAT) to 42 IEC and faculty members. The IRB-RAT includes eight scales assessing various domains related to how investigators and members perceive their ethics committees. Results from t tests revealed significant differences between ideal ratings and descriptive ratings on each of the IRB-RAT scales with ideal ratings being higher than current descriptive ratings on all of the scales (<.001). These findings suggest areas that can be targeted for improvement and also provide important information about the values of Indian IECs.

A 27-year-old female who presented with fever, hematuria, generalized lymphadenopathy was clinically suspected to have lymphoma was subjected to fine needle aspiration of cervical lymph nodes. Cytology of lymph node had numerous histiocytes with phagocytosed lymphocytes, red blood cells and nuclear debris. A diagnosis of secondary HLH was made based on cytological findings, clinical manifestations, and laboratory results. She was treated with steroids and recovered completely. A high degree of clinical suspicion coupled with comprehensive cytology with fine needle aspiration cytology is fruitful in the diagnosis of HLH, a potentially fatal disease and help in the delineation of therapeutic regimen.

VA focal nodular Hürthle cell hyperplasia in Hashimoto's thyroiditis: A diagnostic dilemma on fine needle aspiration.
p2785
aVHürthle cells are seen in a variety of nonneoplastic and neoplastic thyroid gland lesions. Number and morphology of Hürthle cell vary in thyroid aspirate. Occasionally, thyroid aspirate in focal nodular Hürthle cell hyperplasia in Hashimoto's thyroiditis exclusively comprise of Hürthle cells and mimics Hürthle cell neoplasm. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) diagnosis in such cases is challenging. A 60-year-old female presented with goiter and clinical features of hyperthyroidism. FNA smears showed Hürthle cells arranged in flat sheets and lying singly with occasional lymphocytes in Hürthle cell sheets. Repeat aspiration from other site showed lymphocytes, infiltrating the thyroid follicular cells. We conclude that a careful search of lymphocytes in Hürthle cell sheets in cytology smears, multiple aspirates, associated clinical findings and ancillary techniques reduce the diagnostic pitfall and avoid unnecessary surgery.

aVPrimary thyroid lymphomas are rare neoplasms comprising of 1-5% of thyroid malignancies. These are predominantly B-cell in origin. Here, we report a case of 60 years lady, a known case of lymphocytic thyroiditis, diagnosed as thyroid lymphoma (diffuse large B-cell) on fine needle aspiration and confirmed histopathogically and immunohistochemically. She presented with a sudden increase in thyroid swelling. Fine needle aspiration performed showed highly cellular smears comprising predominantly of the monomorphic population of medium to large sized lymphoid cells with high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio and scant cytoplasm. A possibility of thyroid lymphoma possibly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was suggested which was later confirmed on biopsy. Fine needle aspiration provides an easy mode for diagnosing large cell lymphoma like diffuse large B-cell. Hence, an early diagnosis is possible for a timely intervention. Also, cases of lymphocytic thyroiditis should be regularly followed for the development of lymphoma.

FNAC smears showed multiple clusters of small, round to oval cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli and scant cytoplasm. In addition, the background showed deposits of basement membrane type material. This was dark magenta colored pinkish globular material. The globules were occasionally surrounded by the basal type of cells. Occasional cells with elongated nuclei were also noted. Cytological diagnosis of skin adnexal tumor possibly cylindroma was offered. Subsequent histopathology of the swelling showed sheets and clusters of cells in a jigsaw puzzle-like fashion. Deposition of abundant basement membrane-like material was noted in between the tumor cells. A diagnosis of cylindorma was offered. FNAC along with the subcutaneous location of the tumor and absence of primary salivary gland tumor may help to diagnose such rare case.

We present one such case, a 35-year-old lady with a rapidly growing mass over the right angle of mandible. Fine-needle aspiration cytology was done, and smears showed discretely arranged large epithelioid cells with high N:C ratio, prominent single to multiple nucleoli. Occasional binucleated and multinucleated tumor giant cells were also noted. Poorly differentiated carcinoma, high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma, amelanotic melanoma, and pleomorphic sarcoma were included as differential diagnoses. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) revealed Melan-A/MART-1 positivity in some cells and S-100 positivity in most tumor cells. Desmin, pancytokeratin, and leukocyte common antigen were negative. Based on cytomorphological features and ICC findings, a diagnosis of epithelioid variant of amelanotic melanoma was rendered. Later on, true cut biopsy and histologic examination of excised specimen and adjunct immunohistochemistry with positive Melan-A and S-100 confirmed the diagnosis.

aVThis study was conducted to assess the role of cytology in the diagnosis of lung lesions and to compare it with histopathology. It was also intended to evaluate the role of rapid on site evaluation (ROSE) as an adjunct to cytological diagnosis of lung lesions.The study included all the cases of lung lesions, which were diagnosed on cytology followed by histopathology over a period of 2½ years along with ROSE, wherever possible.Cytology was done in total 782 cases of various lung lesions and of this cyto-histopathological correlation was available in 215 cases. ROSE was done in 93.4% of total cases and smears were considered on the site adequate in the first pass in 68.1% cases and in second pass adequacy increased to 93.4%. The diagnostic accuracy of cytology was 75.3%, and that of histology was 86.9% in the diagnosis of lung lesions. The diagnostic accuracy of cytology for squamous cell carcinoma (94.4%) and adenocarcinoma (96.5%) was higher than that of histology.Cytology is comparable to histology in the diagnosis of lung lesions and may even outperform biopsy in lung tumor diagnosis. The advantages of cytology may be further added by better sampling and preanalytical assessment for adequate diagnostic material and ROSE has proved to be an important, easy and cost effective adjunct in this regard. A multidisciplinary approach involving pulmonologist, radiologist and cytopathologist with ROSE, followed by vigilant morphological examination may increase diagnostic utility of cytology for lung lesions.

In Implantology, FEA has been used to study the stress patterns in various implant components and also in the peri-implant bone. It is also useful for studying the biomechanical properties of implants as well as for predicting the success of implants in clinical condition. FEA of simulated traumatic loads can be used to understand the biomechanics of fracture. FEA has various advantages compared with studies on real models. The experiments are repeatable, there are no ethical considerations and the study designs may be modified and changed as per the requirement. There are certain limitations of FEA too. It is a computerized in vitro study in which clinical condition may not be completely replicated. So, further FEA research should be supplemented with clinical evaluation.

These patients were equally divided into three groups based on intrusion technique used, Rickets utility arch (Group I), K-SIR arch (Group II) and RCS arch (Group III). For each patient, amount of intrusion and root resorption occurring during intrusion was measured. Seven angular and six linear cephalometric measurements were made to evaluate skeletal and dental changes before and after incisor intrusion.The mean true incisor intrusion achieved with utility arch was 1.6 mm, with K-SIR, 1.25 mm and with RCS, 0.70 mm respectively. The rate of intrusion of utility arch was 0.44 mm/month, K-SIR - 0.33 mm/month, RCS - 0.35 mm/month, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.451). Utility arch had significantly higher mean root resorption of 1.56 mm as compared to K-SIR of 1.08 mm and RCS of 0.96 mm.Both the intrusion rate and root resorption is more by utility arch while with K-SIR arch, though the rate of intrusion is almost same; the root resorption is much less.

Complete regression of the condition had not been achieved in all cases with any of the present treatment regimens. Curcumin is (diferuloylmethane), a yellow pigment in curry powder, exhibits anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and pro-apoptotic activities. Hence an interventional study was undertaken to establish the efficacy of curcumin in OSMF patients.A randomized open label, interventional study was conducted in forty patients with clinically and histologically proven Oral Submucous Fibrosis.Forty patients with clinically and histologically proven Oral Submucous Fibrosis were selected for the study and were randomly divided into 2 groups. The first group was treated with weekly intralesional injection of 4 mg Dexamethasone & 1500 I.U Hyaluronidase and the second group by oral administration of two Curcumin tablets (Turmix 300 mg) per day for 3 months each. Improvement of burning sensation, interincisal distance and tongue protrusion was evaluated on a weekly basis.Burning sensation improved in both the groups from early to late stages. Complete resolution of burning sensation was noted with turmix. The mean increase in interincisal distance was 3.13 mm and 1.25 mm respectively in groups 1 &2. The interincisal distance improved in both the groups, with significant results at the end of first month. Tongue protrusion showed greater recovery at the end of 1st month in group 1 when compared with group 2.Turmix is beneficial and effective in reducing burning sensation in early OSMF patients.

VPalonosetron Versus Ramosetron Prophylaxis for Control of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting after Cesarean Delivery under Spinal Anesthesia.
p2872
aVPostoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery are distressing to both patients and surgeons. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of palonosetron and ramosetron (both newer and highly potent 5HT3 receptor antagonists) in nausea and vomiting in cesarean delivery after spinal anesthesia.In this randomized, double-blind study, 109 women received either palonosetron (0.075 mg) or ramosetron (0.3 mg) intravenously immediately after clamping of the fetal umbilical cord. Nausea, vomiting, adverse events, and overall satisfaction were then observed for 48 h after administration of spinal anesthesia.A complete response (defined as no postoperative nausea and vomiting) during first 0-2 h postoperative after administration of spinal anesthesia was achieved in 85.5 % of patients with palonosetron and in 83.3 % of patients with ramosetron (p > 0.05). However, the corresponding incidence during 2 to 24 h was 70.9 and 53.7 %, respectively (p < 0.05), while it was 63.3 and 44.4 % at 24-48 h after anesthesia (p < 0.05). Along with a more complete response, the severity of nausea was also lesser with palonosetron during the corresponding study periods (2-24 and 24-48 h, respectively; p < 0.05). Patients who received palonosetron were also more satisfied than those who received ramosetron (p < 0.05). No difference in adverse events was observed in any of the groups.To conclude, prophylactic therapy with palonosetron is more effective than prophylactic therapy with ramosetron for the long-term prevention of PONV after cesarean section.

VFruits and barks extracts of Zanthozyllum heitzii a spice from Cameroon induce mitochondrial dependent apoptosis and Go/G1 phase arrest in human leukemia HL-60 cells.
p2878
aVZanthoxylum heitzii is a spice used to prepare several dishes and to treat tumors, syphilis, malaria, cardiac palpitations, urogenital infections in the west region of Cameroon, but the antitumor mechanisms and chemical composition are not yet investigated. This study was aimed to determine the antiproliferative effects of four extracts from the fruits and barks of Zanthoxyllum heitzii (Rutaceae) on apoptosis in human promyelocytic cells, their mechanisms and the chemical composition. The 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to determine the fifty percent inhibition (IC50) concentration of the cell lines after treatment. The effect on morphology was observed using a light or fluorescence microscopy. The rate of apoptosis and the cell cycle were measured using flow cytometry (FCM). The phytochemical analysis of the extract was carried with HPLC/MS methods.The phytochemical analysis of the extracts indicated the presence of four known polyphenols (Syringic acid, Juglon, Luteolin and Myricetin) in both fruits and barks of Z. heitzii but in different quantities. Syringic acid and Myricetin concentrations were between 17-21 fold higher in the fruits than the stem bark. Rhamnetin (393.35 \u03bcg/mL) and Oleuropein (63.10 \u03bcg/mL) were identified only in the stem barks of Z. heitzii. Among the four extracts tested for cytotoxicity properties, only the methanol extract of fruits and barks significantly inhibited cell proliferation of HL-60 cells with IC50 value of 20 \u03bcg/mL and 12 \u03bcg/mL respectively. HL-60 cells treated with Z. heitzii extracts significantly produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) with concurrent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Modifications in the DNA distribution and enhanced of G1/G0 phase cell cycle arrest were observed in a concentration dependent manner.Polyphenols from Z. heitzii plant exert inhibitory effect on HL-60 cells through the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cell cycle destabilization.

aVLower extremity ulcers and amputations are an increasing problem among individuals with diabetes. Among diabetes mellitus-related complications, foot ulceration is the most common, affecting approximately 15% of diabetic patients during their lifetime. The pathogenesis of diabetic ulcer is peripheral sensory neuropathy, calluses, oedema and peripheral vascular disease. Diabetic ulcer is managed by adequate control of infections and blood sugar levels, surgical debridement with various dressings and off loading of the foot from pressure. In spite of these standard measures, some recalcitrant non-healing ulcers need additional growth factors for healing. Autologous platelet-rich plasma is easy and cost-effective method in treating diabetic ulcers as it provides necessary growth factors which enhance healing.

VSplit Face Comparative Study of Microneedling with PRP Versus Microneedling with Vitamin C in Treating Atrophic Post Acne Scars.
p2900
aVAcne scars are largely preventable complications of acne. 95% of the scars occur over the face thus impacting the quality of life. Correction of scars is the priority for acne patients.Thirty patients with post acne atrophic facial scars attending the OPD during the period from April to October 2013 were offered four sittings of microneedling with PRP on one side and microneedling with vitamin C on other side of the face at an interval of 1 month.Twenty-seven out of the total 30 patients completed the treatment schedule. Two patients were lost to follow up and one dropped out of the study due to severe PIH. Mean age of the patients was 27.5 years. Out of 30 patients, 23 achieved reduction in scarring by one or two grades. Excellent response was seen in five (18.5%) patients with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) as compared to two (7%) patients who received treatment with vitamin C according to physician's assessment. As far as up gradation by 1 score is considered, i.e., good response, it was similar in both cases. Vitamin C did not prove to be as efficacious as PRP since 10 (37%) patients had poor response in vitamin C-treated area compared to only 6 (22.2%) patients who underwent PRP therapy, but vitamin C proved to be efficacious in dealing with post inflammatory hyper-pigmentation secondary to acne. Patients were more satisfied with PRP as compared to vitamin C. The results were evaluated and statistical analysis was done using SPSS 16.0.2.Overall results were better with microneedling and PRP. Vitamin C combined with microneedling also showed improvement with respect to firmness and smoothness of skin; as well as post inflammatory hyper-pigmentation. Microneedling combined with PRP proved to be good in treating boxcar and rolling scars but had limited efficacy in dealing with ice pick scars.

aVImmunotherapy is an evolving therapeutic modality for the treatment of warts. We conducted a study to assess the efficacy and safety of intralesional Mycobacterium w vaccine for the treatment of warts at sites that were difficult to treat.Thirty patients with at least one wart present on either the plantar surface of their feet, palms, volar aspect of their fingers, or periungual or subungual region, were treated with 0.1 ml of killed Mycobacterium w vaccine given intralesionally in a single wart, without any prior sensitisation dose. Thereafter, a single injection of 0.1 ml of vaccine was given at intervals of four weeks in a single wart till there was complete resolution of the warts or a maximum of 10 injections. Treatment was stopped if there was no response after three injections. The patients were followed up for at least six months.Out of the 30 patients, 28 (93.33%) patients had complete resolution of their warts, both at the injected and distant sites. The mean (SD) time for complete clearance of warts was 43.71(32.82) days and the mean (SD) dose of vaccine that was required for complete clearance of warts was 0.186 ml (0.101). Four patients (14.28%) had a recurrence of warts. The treatment was well-tolerated and the side effects were reversible in the majority of the patients.In comparison to the earlier studies using Mycobacterium w vaccine for the treatment of warts, our study was different in the following aspects: No sensitisation dose was given, only a single wart was injected at a time and the duration between the period of injections was increased to four weeks. With all these changes we eliminated the complications due to the sensitisation dose and achieved good results. This study provides new insight into the dose and schedule of treatment of this evolving therapeutic modality.

Besides that onychomycosis, nail lichen planus, nail pitting and ridging due to various diseases also cause cosmetically disfiguring nails.The study is directed toward use of 70% glycolic acid for controlled keratolysis of the nail-plate, resulting that could result in shinier, smoother and brighter nails.A prospective single-center open-label uncontrolled study of 31 patients, 22 with dry, rough, discolored nails and 9 with hyperkeratotic nails were included in the study group. After examination and ruling out any infection, petroleum jelly was applied on the cuticle margins of the nails for protection and 70% glycolic acid was applied over the nail plate for 45 minutes. In dry rough discolored nails, only a single sitting was done while in hyper-keratotic nail conditions multiple weekly sittings were done.In 22 patients with dry rough nails, 80% showed good improvement, 10% showed average improvement, whereas 10% were non-responsive. Nine patients with thickened nail plate showed good improvement in 60% average improvement in 25% improvement and 15% were non-responsive, after multiple sessions.Controlled keratolysis of the nail plate with application of 70% glycolic acid can be a promising treatment for modality for thick, uneven, rough and pigmented nail-plate conditions with cosmetically pleasing results.

aVThe utility of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has spanned various fields of dermatology from chronic ulcer management to trichology and aesthetics, due to its role in wound healing. Though PRP is being used over a long time, there is still confusion over proper terminology to define, classify and describe the different variations of platelet concentrates. There is also a wide variation in the reported protocols for standardization and preparation of PRP, in addition to lack of accurate characterization of the tested products in most articles on the topic. Additionally, the high cost of commercially available PRP kits, precludes its use over a larger population. In this article, we review the principles and preparation methods of PRP based on available literature and place our perspective in standardizing a safe, simple protocol that can be followed to obtain an optimal consistent platelet yield.

VCharacterizing alpha helical properties of Ebola viral proteins as potential targets for inhibition of alpha-helix mediated protein-protein interactions.
p2916
aVEbola, considered till recently as a rare and endemic disease, has dramatically transformed into a potentially global humanitarian crisis. The genome of Ebola, a member of the Filoviridae family, encodes seven proteins. Based on the recently implemented software (PAGAL) for analyzing the hydrophobicity and amphipathicity properties of alpha helices (AH) in proteins, we characterize the helices in the Ebola proteome. We demonstrate that AHs with characteristically unique features are involved in critical interactions with the host proteins. For example, the Ebola virus membrane fusion subunit, GP2, from the envelope glycoprotein ectodomain has an AH with a large hydrophobic moment. The neutralizing antibody (KZ52) derived from a human survivor of the 1995 Kikwit outbreak recognizes a protein epitope on this AH, emphasizing the critical nature of this secondary structure in the virulence of the Ebola virus. Our method ensures a comprehensive list of such `hotspots'. These helices probably are or can be the target of molecules designed to inhibit AH mediated protein-protein interactions. Further, by comparing the AHs in proteins of the related Marburg viruses, we are able to elicit subtle changes in the proteins that might render them ineffective to previously successful drugs. Such differences are difficult to identify by a simple sequence or structural alignment. Thus, analyzing AHs in the small Ebola proteome can aid rational design aimed at countering the `largest Ebola epidemic, affecting multiple countries in West Africa' ( http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/index.html).

Recently several failures in terms of developing disease-modifying therapies needs to be communicated effectively as per their process and cause which have led to a debate about the potential deficiencies in our understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD and choice of therapeutic targets. So that the thoroughly development of drug candidates and study design of clinical trials is done.Various online medical databases were searched for relevant study and publications. Different clinical trials were reviewed and the available data in clinical trials describing the effective drug development status of IBD medications.The aminosalicylates, anti-inflammatory and biological molecules tested for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) but the risks of common and rare adverse events were found with treatment. Antibiotics and steroid help in reducing the immune response but further studies required on each molecule to substantiate treatment strategies. There has been significant research on different drug molecules as per the phase, which is summarized in this review.Preclinical research on the complex IBD puzzle coupled with an active and vibrant research agenda in recent decades which might reveal patterns of pharmacological interactions instead of single potential drug targets. The increased collaboration between pharmaceutical companies, basic researchers and clinical researchers has the potential to bring us closer to developing an optimum pharmaceutical approach for the treatment of IBD.

VA review on Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and its management: an update.
p2922
aVAlzheimer's disease acknowledged as progressive multifarious neurodegenerative disorder, is the leading cause of dementia in late adult life. Pathologically it is characterized by intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloidal protein deposits contributing to senile plaques. Over the last two decades, advances in the field of pathogenesis have inspired the researchers for the investigation of novel pharmacological therapeutics centered more towards the pathophysiological events of the disease. Currently available treatments i.e. acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine, galantamine, donepezil) and N-methyl d-aspartate receptor antagonist (memantine) contribute minimal impact on the disease and target late aspects of the disease. These drugs decelerate the progression of the disease, provide symptomatic relief but fail to achieve a definite cure. While the neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease are recognized but the intricacies of the mechanism have not been clearly defined. This lack of understanding regarding the pathogenic process may be the likely reason for the non-availability of effective treatment which can prevent onset and progression of the disease. Owing to the important progress in the field of pathophysiology in the last couple of years, new therapeutic targets are available that should render the underlying disease process to be tackled directly. In this review, authors will discusses the different aspects of pathophysiological mechanisms behind Alzheimer's disease and its management through conventional drug therapy, including modern investigational therapeutic strategies, recently completed and ongoing.

Visual acuity and other ocular examinations were normal. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging revealed a well-defined fusiform retrobulbar lesion in the left orbit extending into the superior orbital fissure and left cavernous sinus measuring 43 mm × 21 mm × 19 mm and causing superomedial displacement of the optic nerve and axial proptosis. The patient was scheduled for surgery, and gross total excision was done. Postoperatively, the patient developed total third nerve palsy. Pre and postoperative third nerve deficit confirmed the origin of the tumor from the oculomotor nerve. Histopathological examination revealed schwannoma.Orbital oculomotor nerve schwannoma, although rare, can be the cause of proptosis. Diagnosis can be confirmed histopathologically. It is a benign tumor; however, it can extend intracranially without any neurological symptoms. Therefore, neuroimaging is essential to rule out intracranial extension. Early surgical removal is mandatory.

Autologous hCjEC grafts were prepared from conjunctival biopsy specimens excised from the healthy eye and cultured ex vivo on human amniotic membrane mounted on inserts using a unique mounting device. The hCjEC grafts were then transported in an in-house designed transport container for transplantation. Post-surgery, the patients were followed up on days 1, 7, 14, 30, 90, and 180 as per the approved study protocol. Clinical outcomes were assessed by slit lamp examination, visual acuity, imprint cytology, fluorescein/rose bengal staining, Schirmer's test, and photographic evaluation three and 6 months post-transplantation.Two patients were lost to follow-up and final analysis included 23 cases. No recurrence of pterygium was observed in 18 (78.3%) patients; all of these eyes showed a smooth conjunctival surface without epithelial defects. Recurrence was observed in 5 (21.7%) patients at 3 months post-treatment. No conjunctival inflammation, secondary infections or other complications were reported. Adequate goblet cells were present in 19 (82.6%) patients at the site of transplantation.We have, for the 1(st) time, standardized a protocol for preparing autologous hCjEC grafts that can be safely transported to multiple centers across the country for transplantation. The clinical outcome was satisfactory for treating pterygia.

The consequences of premature loss of primary teeth are well known, namely the loss of vertical dimension of occlusion, tongue thrusting and mouth breathing habits, which can be the sources of future malocclusion. Satisfactory restoration of these teeth, improving esthetics, along with the management of space and function has always been a challenge for pediatric dentist. An ever increasing demand for esthetics has led to innovation and development of newer treatment modalities for these problems. In an attempt to widen the treatment options as biologically and conservatively as possible, tooth structure is used as a restorative material to rehabilitate severely destroyed tooth crowns. This technique consists of bonding sterile dental fragments, obtained either from the patient or from a tooth bank, to the teeth. Such a technique was termed as 'biological restoration'. This article aims at reviewing the evolution, techniques and outcome of such biological restorations. How to cite this article: MD Indira, Dhull KS, Nandlal B, Kumar PSP, Dhull RS.

VA Comparative Evaluation of Effect of Different Chemical Solvents on the Shear Bond Strength of Glass Fiber reinforced Post to Core Material.
p2961
aVTo compare the effect of different chemical solvents on glass fiber reinforced posts and to study the effect of these solvents on the shear bond strength of glass fiber reinforced post to core material.This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of three chemical solvents, i.e. silane coupling agent, 6% H2O2 and 37% phosphoric acid on the shear bond strength of glass fiber post to a composite resin restorative material. The changes in post surface characteristics after different treatments were also observed, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and shear bond strength was analyzed using universal testing machine (UTM).Surface treatment with hydrogen peroxide had greatest impact on the post surface followed by 37% phosphoric acid and silane. On evaluation of the shear bond strength, 6% H2O2 exhibited the maximum shear bond strength followed in descending order by 37% phosphoric acid and silane respectively.The surface treatment of glass fiber post enhances the adhesion between the post and composite resin which is used as core material. Failure of a fiber post and composite resin core often occurs at the junction between the two materials. This failure process requires better characterization.

aVDental age is important for treatment planning in the specialities of pedodontics and orthodontics. Although, Demirjian's method was considered standard for dental age estimation, it may not be reliable for all population.The goal of the study was to evaluate the reliability of Demir-jian's, Haavikko's and Willems method of dental age estimation methods in Visakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh, India) children.One hundred and two children of 6 to 14 years old who underwent panaromic digital radiography for routine diagnostic purposes were included. Dental age was calculated using Demirjian's, Haavikko's and Willems methods and compared with chronologic age for each patient.Dental age showed a significant overestimation by Demirjian's method with a mean difference of 0.55 year and underestimation by Haavikko's and Willems methods with a mean difference of 1.95 and 0.20 year respectively when compared with chronologic age. The mean difference between dental age and chronologic age was not significant in Willems method which shows a close relation between dental and chronologic ages.The dental age estimation by Willems method is found to be more accurate than Demirjian's and Haavikko's methods in Visakhapatnam children.

VMercury exposure levels in children with dental amalgam fillings.
p2967
aVMercury combined with other metals to form solid amalgams has long been used in reconstructive dentistry but its use has been controversial since at least the middle of the 19th century. The exposure and body burden of mercury reviews have consistently stated that there is a deficiency of adequate epidemiological studies addressing this issue. Fish and dental amalgam are two major sources of human exposure to organic (MeHg) and inorganic Hg respectively.A total of 150 subjects aged between 9 and 14 years were divided into two groups of 75 subjects each depending on their diet, i.e. seafood or nonseafood consuming. Each category was subdivided into three groups based on number of restorations. Scalp hair and urine samples were collected at baseline and 3 months later to assess the organic and inorganic levels of mercury respectively by atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS).The mean values of urinary mercury (inorganic mercury) in the group of children with restorations were 1.5915 \u03bcg/l as compared to 0.0130 \u03bcg/l in the groups with no amalgam restorations (p < 0.001) (Wilcoxon sign rank test and paired t-test). The hair mercury levels (organic mercury) varied signi-ficantly between the fsh-eating group and nonfsh-eating group, the average values being 1.03 \u03bcg/l and 0.84 \u03bcg/l respectively (p < 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U-test and paired t-test).The notion about the mercury being released from the amalgam restorations as a sole exposure source needs to be put to a rest, as environmental factors collectively overpower the exposure levels from restorations alone.

Assessment of anxiety and analysis of data were conducted blind to experimental condition. Assessment of anxiety was carried out in the waiting room prior intervention, postintervention into the operatory during the treatment and again after the completion of treatment. Anticipatory anxiety was recorded by Venham's picture test (VPT).Sixty children of 7 to 12 years age group.PARTICIPANTS were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In both conditions the participant was asked to look at photographs for 2 minutes in the waiting area prior to their appointment. The intervention consisted of viewing positive images of dentistry and dental treatment (study group), the (control group) consisted of neutral images. The assessment of anticipatory dental anxiety was made blind to experimental condition and statistical analysis was conducted blind to group membership. Anticipatory anxiety assessed by the VP T.A total of 60 subjects participated in the study and were equally and randomly allotted to study group (positive image) and control group (neutral image). The mean anxiety score found at waiting area before intervention, after intervention (OPD) and postoperative was statistically significant in study group. Post hoc comparison of anxiety score in study group showed high statistical significance.Positive dental images have an effect on reducing anxiety as compared to neutral images when measured by the VPT.

Principles of minimal invasive approach indicate the need to excavate only carious tissue.The aim of this study was to compare the microleakage in conventional and resin modified glass ionomer cement restorations following conventional and chemomechanical caries removal.Hundred class I carious human mandibular first molar s were collected and divided into two groups: I and II (50 each). Each group was further divided into subgroups, i.e. (IA, IB and IIA, IIB). Caries was completely removed using conventional method in group one and chemomechanically in group two. The teeth in group IA, IIA are restored with conventional glass ionomer comment (GIC) and in group IB, IIB restored with resign-modified glass ionomer comments (RMGIC), followed by fnishing and polishing. Subsequently, the specimens were thermocycled and then placed in dye solution. The teeth were sectioned through the restorations and evaluated for microleakage scores using a stereomicroscope. The data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U-test.Statistical analysis showed no significant difference in microleakage between the conventional GIC and RMGIC following conventional and chemomechanical caries removal method.Carisolv is minimally invasive and an effective alternative treatment for the removal of occlusal caries.

VComparison of Proximal Caries Detection in Primary Teeth between Laser Fluorescence and Bitewing Radiography: An in vivo Study.
p2979
aVProximal caries detection is of great importance because of the rapid rate of caries progression and the difficulty in determining the absence or presence of a lesion in primary dentition. Although, various methods for caries diagnosis offer good diagnostic performances, they provide varying sensitivities for detecting proximal carious lesions. The objective of this study was to compare, in vivo, the accuracy of DIAGNOdent and bitewing radiography at detecting proximal caries in primary teeth.One Hundred and one primary maxillary and mandibular molars without obvious cavities of children between the age group of 3 and 10 years were included. The teeth were first subjected to DIAGNOdent examination followed by bitewing radiography. The specificity and sensitivity of the systems were calculated.At the dentin caries (D3) level, the sensitivity of DIAGNOdent and bitewing radiography was 78.5%; at the enamel caries (D1 and D2) level it was 39.12% and for the sound teeth (D0) it was found to be 76.52%. A strong association was observed between the DIAGNOdent and the bitewing radiograph (p < 0.001).The DIAGNOdent can be used as an alternative diagnostic method in detection of proximal caries in primary teeth. But when seen at the each caries level, the DIAGNOdent is more accurate at the D0 and D3 threshold. How to cite this article: Mepparambath R, Bhat SS, Hegde SK, Anjana G, Sunil M, Mathew S.

aVTooth agenesis is one of the most common congenital anomalies seen in humans. Although absence of one or more teeth is common but absence of multiple teeth is rare. Oligodontia is a rare developmental anomaly, involving agenesis of six or more permanent teeth, excluding the third molars. The reported prevalence of oligodontia in permanent dentition is 0.14%. Oligodontia can present as an isolated condition or as a part of a syndrome. The present case report highlights a unique case of non syndromic oligodontia, with agenesis of four permanent incisors, left permanent canine and right second premolar in the mandibular arch and its management with a novel fixed functional prosthetic appliance. Prosthetic rehabilitation is an urgent need for these kind of patients so that they do not suffer from masticatory and esthetic problems which can eventually lower the self esteem of individuals.

aVTo evaluate and compare the frictional resistance produced by Super Slick modules during sliding with four different types of brackets and four ligature types both in conventional and figure-of-8 ligation method with saliva as lubricant.The frictional resistance was evaluated by using four different ligatures on 0.019" × 0.025" stainless steel (SS) archwires using four different brackets using an universal testing machine with unstimulated saliva as a lubricant. Mean and SD values were calculated. Data was statistically analyzed using analysis of variance ANOVA with post hoc test.The results showed that self-ligating brackets produced least frictional forces. Among all other tested combinations,Tefon-coated SS ligatures in ceramic with metal slot brackets produced least coefficient of static and kinetic friction and full ceramic brackets ligated with Super Slick elastomeric modules demonstrated the highest, with other combinations falling in between.Super Slick elastomeric modules, produced highest coefficient of both static and kinetic friction with the conventional and figure-of-8 ligation technique even in wet conditions using natural fresh human saliva.Both static and kinetic frictional resistance play an important role during sliding mechanics. Various factors have been attributed for friction. However, bracket type, archwire material, type of ligature and method of ligation are important variables. Recently polymeric coated slick elastomeric modules were introduced with the claim that they produce very low frictional forces in wet condition. Contrary to the claim made by the manufacturers of Super Slick elastomeric modules, they produced highest coefficient of both static and kinetic friction with the conventional and figure-of-8 ligation technique.

aVMost physiological processes in living systems are fundamentally regulated by protein-ligand interactions. Understanding the process of ligand recognition by proteins is a vital activity in molecular biology and biochemistry. It is well known that the residues present at the binding site of the protein form pockets that provide a conducive environment for recognition of specific ligands. In many cases, the boundaries of these sites are not well defined. Here, we provide a web-server to systematically evaluate important residues in the binding site of the protein that contribute towards the ligand recognition through in silico alanine-scanning mutagenesis experiments. Each of the residues present at the binding site is computationally mutated to alanine. The ligand interaction energy is computed for each mutant and the corresponding \u0394\u0394G values are calculated by comparing it to the wild type protein, thus evaluating individual residue contributions towards ligand interaction. The server will thus provide a ranked list of residues to the user in order to obtain loss-of-function mutations. This web-tool can be freely accessed through the following address: http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/abscan/.

We synthesized ten cationic amphiphiles differing in nature of cationic charged head groups using lithocholic acid. We observed that anticancer activities of these amphiphiles against colon cancer cell lines are contingent on nature of charged head group. Lithocholic acid based amphiphile possessing piperidine head group (LCA-PIP1 ) is ~10 times more cytotoxic as compared to its precursor. Biochemical studies revealed that enhanced activity of LCA-PIP1 as compared to lithocholic acid is due to greater activation of apoptosis.LCA-PIP1 induces sub G0 arrest and causes cleavage of caspases. A single dose of lithocholic acid-piperidine derivative is enough to reduce the tumor burden by 75% in tumor xenograft model.

Most of these are situated in the superolateral and superomedial angle of the orbit. We report a case of recurrent primary hydatid cysts of the orbit, situated in different locations in the orbit. A 35-year-old female patient was admitted to Department of Neurosurgery with proptosis, ptosis and watering from left eye. She also complained for headache with excruciating pain in left eye and loss of vision in left eye. Neurological examination revealed limited ocular mobility in all directions. Visual acuity was reduced to finger counting at 2-feet distance. Papilledema was found in ophthalmic examination. This case was considered as recurrence of primary infection because there was no previous history of hydatid disease and no finding of liver and lung cysts on radiological examinations. Treatment of orbital hydatid cyst, early diagnosis, surgical excision and systemic use of albendazole are suggested.

VGranulocytic sarcoma presenting as presenting as monoparesis: A rare case report.
p3043
aVGranulocytic sarcomas (GSs) or myeloid sarcoma or chloroma are rare, destructive, extramedullary tumor masses that consist of immature granulocytic cells. We present case of a 35-year-old man presenting as monoparesis, diagnosed to have cervical intradural extramedullary mass lesion with an extradural extension. Although the history or physical examination had no symptoms and signs suggestive of leukemia, bone marrow study and blood picture indicated chronic myeloid leukemia. Surgical decompression was done, and histopathological examination was consistent with GS. GSs have been observed in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and other myeloproliferative disorders, but rarely have been reported as first presentation of the disease.

VBilateral large traumatic hemorrhage of the basal ganglion.
p3049
aVTraumatic bilateral basal ganglia bleed is extremely rare. It is defined as a hemorrhagic lesion located in the basal ganglia or neighboring structures such as the internal capsule and the thalamus. This report describes a 37-year-old man who had large bilateral basal ganglia hemorrhage (BGH) with subdural hematoma and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. With regards to an etiology of bilateral hemorrhage of the basal ganglia, we could not disclose any possible cause except head injury in spite of full diagnostic work-up. Our final diagnosis was bilateral traumatic BGH (TBGH). The pathomechanism of such injuries is still not clear and it is proposed to be due to shear injury to the lenticulostriate and choroidal arteries. Rather than any features of the TBGH itself, duration of coma and/or associated temporal herniation predicted slower recovery and worse outcome. Bilateral TBGH is an extremely rare entity, compatible with a favorable recovery, if not associated with damage to other cortical and subcortical structures and occurring in isolation. TBGH can be considered as a marker of poor outcome rather than its cause. The BGHs seem to be hemorrhagic contusions resulting from a shearing injury, due to high velocity impact.

VJuvenile Xanthogranuloma of adult spine: A rare case and review of literature.
p3052
aVJuvenile Xanthogranuloma (JXG) is a rare disorder of central nervous system. It rarely produces compressive myelopathy. On reviewing world literature, we could find only nine cases of this disease involving spine and of which only four cases were in adults' i.e., 18 years and above. We are presenting a case of Spinal JXG in an 18-year-old male with thoracic compressive myelopathy presenting as short duration progressive paraparesis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Spine showed mass lesion in epidural space compressing cord from behind without any bony involvement at D7 to D10 vertebral segment. It was isointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2 with no contrast enhancement. D7 to D10 Laminectomy with complete excision of firm epidural mass was carried out. The histopathology with tumor markers confirmed the diagnosis of JXG. Post-operative neurological recovery in this patient was good. His power improved to grade 5/5 with decreased spasticity. Follow-up MRI at 3 months showed no residual tumor. This case appears to be the first in the series with entirely extradural component in adult thoracic spine.

We report a male child with a posterior third ventricular CPP who presented with the symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed hydrocephalus related to a mass in the posterior third ventricle, occluding the aqueduct of Sylvius. After endoscopic third ventriculostomy, tumor was approached through the infratentorial-supracerebellar approach and completely excised. Pathological examination revealed a typical CPP.

VImportance of C1 laminectomy in foramen magnum decompression surgery: A technical note.
p3061
aVArnold-Chiari malformations (ACM) of the brain result from aberrations in the development of the posterior fossa resulting in its smaller volume leading to tonsillar herniation. The most common type includes Type I ACM where tonsillar descent reaches up to either C1 or C2 along with cervico-dorsal syringomyelia. The surgery (foramen magnum decompression, [FMD]) is usually straight forward and includes sub-occipital craniectomy and cervical laminectomy based on the level of descent. Rarely inadequate cervical laminectomy of C1 arch may result in residual compression at the level of obex even after "lax" duraplasty. A cervico-dural angle (angle between the neo-dura and cervical dura) at level foramen magnum can be observed in these patients. This angle is usually obtuse in imaging of cranio-vertebral junction (CVJ) of normal people and in postoperative patients of Chiari malformations where normal anatomy is restored. Inadequate C1 laminectomy may result in an acute cervico-dural angle with residual compression at the level of CVJ. Therefore, C1 laminectomy becomes a key step in FMD surgery that is often underemphasized, and neurosurgeons should be careful in doing it adequately.

aVLesions occupying the anterior cranial fossa may arise de novo or are extensions from the sino-nasal areas with a handful of differentials in either group. The imaging findings, though to a large extent standardized are not full proof. Primary central nervous system lymphoma and sino-nasal lymphoma are uncommon variants of extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). We encountered a 35-year-old lady presenting with headache and seizures with a mass lesion involving the ethmoids with invasion into the anterior cranial fossa diagnosed as T-cell extranodal NHL. Gross total resection and reconstruction of the skull base were done. She was treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy and is doing well at 6 months follow-up. This is the first report of a sino-nasal T-cell lymphoma invading the brain-parenchyma in an immuno-competent person. Sino-nasal primary T-cell lymphoma presenting as skull base pathology should form an essential differential diagnosis along with other routine lesions of anterior cranial fossa. Since these lesions have a good response to chemo and radiotherapy, a trans-nasal biopsy may obviate the need of a craniotomy if neurosurgeons are aware of this rare entity.

VExtramedullary foramen magnum tumors and their surgical management: An experience with 29 cases.
p3071
aVSurgical management of foramen magnum (FM) tumors is challenging by virtue of their location and vital neurovascular relationships. The ideal approach to anterior/anterolateral tumors continue to evoke controversy even in the modern era. In this article, we present and discuss our experience in the surgical management of these tumors.This retrospective study includes 29 consecutive patients (mean age 36.6 years, M: F = 2.63:1) of extramedullary tumors at the surgical foramen magnum, operated at our center, between 2007 and 2012.Their mean duration of symptoms was 14. 6 months. A majority of the patients presented with motor symptoms (quadri/paraparesis, n = 21, 72.4%), neck pain with/without suboccipital radiation (n = 16, 55.2%) and sensory symptoms like tingling/numbness (n = 16, 55.2%). There were nine extradural (31%) and 20 intradural tumors (69%). Most of the tumors were located posterolateral to the neuraxis (n = 13, 44.8%). Nerve sheath tumors (n = 11, 38%) and meningiomas (n = 5, 17.2%) were the most commonly encountered histologies in our series. The standard posterior approach was the most frequently employed surgical approach (n = 20, 69%). Operative mortality and morbidity were 3.4 and 18.9%, respectively. At a mean follow-up of 27.3 months, 13 out of the 18 available patients improved.A majority of the foramen magnum tumors are amenable to excision via the standard posterior approach. Small anterior dural-based meningiomas/recurrent tumors may require a lateral approach like the far lateral approach.

p3074
aVWith the advancement of technologies there is more interest in the maintenance of the spine's biomechanical properties focusing on the preservation of the functional motion segment. In present article we describe our experience with 25 cases managed with artificial cervical discs with 28 Solis cage following cervical discectomy with a mean follow-up period of 7.5 year.All surgeries were performed by single surgeon from March 2004 to June 2005 with a follow-up till date. Patients with symptomatic single or multiple level diseases that had no prior cervical surgery were candidates for the study. Cohort demographics were comparable. Standardized clinical outcome measures and radiographic examinations were used at prescribed post-operative intervals to compare the treatment groups. Relief in radicular pain, cervical spine motion, and degenerative changes at follow-up were noted.In a total 53 cases, the mean age in prosthesis group was 47 years (age range: 30-63 years) and mean age in cage group was 44 years (32-62 years). Mean hospital stay was 2.7 days in both the groups. At 4 weeks complete cervical movements could be achieved in 19 cases in artificial disc group. Maintenance of movement after 7.5 years was in 76% of these patients. Lordosis was maintained in all cases till date. There was no mortality or wound infection in our series.We conclude that artificial cervical disc could be an alternative to fixed spinal fusion as it represents the most physiological substitute of disc. However, there is need for further studies to support the use of artificial cervical disc prosthesis.

VSurgical outcome in patients with cervical ossified posterior longitudinal ligament: A single institutional experience.
p3077
aVOssification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a complex multi-factorial disease process having both metabolic and biomechanical factors. The role of surgical intervention as well as the choice of approach weather anterior or posterior is ambiguous. The objective of this study was to assess the surgical out come and post operative functional improvement in patients with cervical OPLL at a tertiary care centre.This prospective study included 63 patients of cervical OPLL who underwent either anterior and/or posterior surgeries in Department of Neurosurgery, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad between June 2009 to May 2011. Patient's data including age, sex, pre and post operative functional status, radiographic findings and OPLL subtypes were recorded and analyzed over a follow up ranging up to minimum two years.The mean age of the patients was 51.1 (range 30-80 years) involving 14 women and 49 men. Out of 63 patients, 14 patients underwent surgery by anterior approach (corpectomy and fusion) and all of them improved (P = 0.52). 49 patients underwent surgery by posterior approach where decompressive laminectomy was performed in 40, laminectomy with instrumentation was done in 5, laminoplasty was done in 3 and 1 patient underwent both anterior and posterior surgeries. Of those who underwent posterior surgery, 40 patients improved, 7 remained the same as their preoperative status (who were having signal intensity changes on T2W MRI) and 2 patients deteriorated in the immediate post operative period and then showed gradual improvement. All the patients were followed up for 24 months. The mean pre-operative Nurick grade was 2.82 which later on improved to 2.03 post surgery (P < 0.05). Minor complications included wound infections in two patients (1.26%).Anterior cervical decompression and reconstruction is a safe and appropriate treatment for cervical spondylitic myelopathy in the setting of single or two level OPLL. Laminectomy or laminoplasty is indicated in patients with preserved cervical lordosis having three or more levels of involvement. Younger patients with good pre operative functional status and less than 2 levels of involvement have better outcome following anterior surgery.

In all 20 consecutive symptomatic patients with a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnosis of colloid cyst who came to the senior author between 2008 and 2011 were included in the study. The patient was kept supine with the head positioned neutrally in the sagittal plane and neck flexed at 20°. The tube of a 5 ml plastic syringe having an external diameter of 13 mm and an internal diameter of 12.6 mm was cut toward the nozzle end to the appropriate length depending upon the cortical thickness measured on the preoperative MRI.The average operative time was around 90 min with maximum of 120 min. None of the patients had seizures preoperatively or postoperatively and in all cases antiepileptic medication could be stopped after 3-6 month of surgery. Two patients had short-term memory impairment which returned to near normal by 1-year following surgery.A volume of 5 ml plastic syringe port technique decreases the operative morbidity and operative time. The wider corridor of working makes the simultaneously maneuverability of two surgical instruments feasible enhancing safety and completeness of excision.

aVTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of disability. Depression is one of the major squeal of TBI in both in-patient and out-patient populations. Depression is associated with numerous negative outcomes, thus affecting quality-of-life (QOL) adversely in these patients. Addressing depression in treatment regimen of TBI may improve QOL of these patients.The present study is designed to evaluate the role of sertraline in post TBI depression and its impact on QOL.Eighty male patients with post TBI depression were included in the study among the 250 male patients of mild to moderate TBI recruited for the evaluation. Half of the patients were given sertraline 50 mg PO, whereas other half served as control without sertraline treatment. Participants were assessed on Glasgow Coma scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and World Health Organization QOL (WHOQOL) at regular interval till the end of 6 months.Depression was found in 35.6% of total patients recruited. Most of the patients (63.1%) were below 35 years of age. Depression was more common in mild TBI cases than those with moderate TBI (53.7% vs. 46.25%, P = 0.04). Left side brain injury (56.25%) with cerebral contusions was more commonly associated with depression (P = 0.04). Patients in sertraline group responded well to treatment with significant improvement in mod symptoms (PHQ-9 score 14.88 ± 3.603 vs. 5.33 ± 2.98, P = 0.04)). All the four domains of QOL improved significantly in sertraline group than the control group with sertraline treatment.Management of TBI should also focus on treatment of associated mood symptoms, which is likely to be associated with poor QOL in these patients. Sertraline has been found to be effective in the treatment of depression with significant improvement in QOL in TBI patients.

aVIntramedullary spinal cord tumors (IMSCT) are rare neoplasms of central nervous system but require proper evaluation and management to ensure a good outcome. This study was carried out to evaluate the functional outcome of IMSCT following surgery and to decipher the factors affecting optimal outcome of these cases.A prospective clinical study was carried out at a tertiary care center from 2003 to 2012. Forty three patients with intramedullary tumors diagnosed on magnetic resonance imaging were included. Their clinical details, neurological findings and demographic data were recorded. The patients were then subjected to surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. The patients were followedup clinically and radiologically, and all parameters examined and recorded.Sensory and motor impairment was present preoperatively in majority of patients (n = 39 and n = 38, 90.7% and 88.4%, respectively). Gross total excision was performed in 30 cases (69.76%). The most common histological diagnosis was ependymoma (n = 21, 48.8%). Postoperatively 32 patients (74.4%) were in McCormick functional Grade I or II improving from 13 cases (30.2%) in Grade I or II preoperatively. Fifteen of 17 patients in Medical Research Council (MRC) Grade III and 10 out of 12 patients in Grade MRC IV improved. No mortality was recorded during the entire period of follow-up (mean: 22, range: 3-96 months). Eight patients (18.6%) had recurrence till the last follow-up visit.Preoperative neurological grade was the most important predictor of functional outcome. Gross tumor excision was the best surgical modality to improve event free survival. High-grade tumors had higher rates of recurrence but no effect on functional outcome.

The relation between time of appearance of coproantigens in feces and anti-Fasciola antibodies in serum was evaluated.The earliest diagnostic coproantigen was recorded at 21(st), 25(th) and 28(th) day post-infection (p.i.) in groups of rabbits infected with 30, 25 and 10 F. gigantica EMC respectively. Both HIS and ES HIS were able to detect coproantigens in feces of rabbits infected with 30 EMC at day 21 p.i. The appearance of F. gigantica coproantigens in feces of infected rabbits was concurrent to the appearance of anti-Fasciola antibodies in blood (3(rd) week p.i.). However, coproantigen has specific ability for direct assessment of active infection with minimal cross-reaction with other heterologous parasitic infections.The findings hold promise for a more accurate diagnostic technique in the near future for suspected Fasciola infection.

aVCanine parvovirus (CPV) is an enteric pathogen causing hemorrhagic enteritis in pups of 3-6 months of age and is mainly transmitted via feco-oral route. In the present study, a total of 85 animals rectal swabs suspected of CPV were tested using a PCR, nested PCR and a newly designed differential PCR. Using PCR 7 (8.23 %) animals were positive whereas 39 (45.88 %) were positive by using nested PCR and 40 (47.05 %) were positive for either one or more than one antigenic types of CPV using differential PCR. Using differential PCR it was found that CPV-2a and CPV-2b were the most prevailing antigenic types. Also it was found that dogs that were vaccinated too yielded positive CPV indicating a possible presence of additional CPV antigenic types. Thus, the primers used in differential PCR can be used in a single PCR reaction to detect various antigenic types of CPV.

VBaculovirus mediated transduction: analysis of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein pseudotyping.
p3098
aVThe recombinant baculoviruses were constructed to investigate the necessity of VSV-G pseudotyping for mammalian cell transduction. The viruses were designed to express green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter, with or without pseudotyping with VSV-G. VSV-G was placed under the control of polyhedrin promoter that is recognized by insect cells, allowing the formation of pseudotyped baculovirus. The study findings demonstrate that the pseudotyping of baculovirus significantly enhanced transduction efficiency compared to non-pseudotyped baculovirus, resulting in consequent distinction in the expression of GFP in mammalian cells. The results confirmed that pseudotyping is important for baculovirus mediated gene delivery. Further, when full-length VSV-G pseudotyping was compared with truncated VSV-G containing GED domain (G-stem of ectodomain in conjunction with the TM and CT domains of the glycoprotein), latter was relatively less efficient in transducing mammalian cells. This study demonstrated that pseudotyping with full-length VSV-G had better transduction efficiency in mammalian cells. However, at higher multiplicity of infection, both full-length and truncated VSV-G showed equivalent transduction. This study established the significance of pseudotyping of baculovirus with full-length VSV-G for efficient transduction of mammalian cells, utilizing the highly sensitive GFP marker system. These findings have significant implications in designing of baculovirus vector based antigen delivery for developing new generation vaccines.

Various drugs have been studied over the past century to achieve this goal. We performed a comprehensive review of the antibiotics which have been used for intravitreal route and the pharmacokinetic factors influencing the drug delivery and safety profile of these antibiotics. Using online resources like PubMed and Google Scholar, articles were reviewed. The articles were confined to the English language only. We present a broad overview of pharmacokinetic concepts fundamental for use of intravitreal antibiotics in endophthalmitis along with a tabulated compendium of the intravitreal antibiotics using available literature.

The prevalence of CSA was found to be high in India as well as throughout the world. CSA is an extensive problem and even the lowest prevalence includes a huge number of victims. It also has various adverse effects on the psychological, physical, behavioral, and interpersonal well-being of the victim. Hence, stringent measures should be taken for the prevention and control of this hidden public health issue.

VStandard treatment guidelines in primary healthcare practice.
p3141
aVIn India, healthcare delivery is implemented at primary, secondary and tertiary levels. Of these, primary health care is the essential health care and is the first point of care for the public across the country. The primary health care system caters to nearly 70% of the population by treating about 90% of the common and locally prevailing problems. One of the integral elements of primary health care is provision of essential medicines, which should be available at all times in adequate amounts in appropriate dosage forms and at an affordable cost. It has an important bearing on the medical, economical and social outcomes of the healthcare delivery system. This situation mandates the need for rational use of medicines by standardizing the treatment of commonly occurring illness at the primary health care level. Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) have been in vogue in India only since recent times and is gaining popularity among practitioners. STGs have many advantages for the patients, healthcare providers, drug manufacturers and marketing agencies, and above all, the policy makers and the legislative system of the country. The drawback in STGs lies in the difficulties in implementation on a large scale. With due efforts to prioritize the health needs, comprehensive coverage of national health programs involving all the stakeholders including professional organizations, undergraduate medical curriculum planners and medical practitioners, STGs can be implemented effectively and thereby we can ensure a quality health care at the primary care level at an affordable cost as part of the now redefined Universal Health Coverage. This article is intended as a guide to understand the concept of STGs, prepared with the aim of capacity building for medical professionals in rationally treating patients in their day-to-day clinical practice.

VLevel of awareness regarding some zoonotic diseases, among dog owners of ithaca, new york.
p3144
aVWorldwide, dogs and cats are the two most common household companion animals. Because of this, they can be direct or indirect source of many human infections. Fortunately, most of these zoonotic infections can be clinically prevented by appropriate prophylactic interventions.Present kind of cross-sectional study, for the first time, was conducted in city of Ithaca, New York. People visiting local animal hospitals, dog parks, library and shoppers at Walmart supermarket were personally interviewed and a pre-tested questionnaire was got filled from every individual. The collected data were analyzed for percentage proportions using Microsoft Excel(®) and the results had been presented in graphical as well as tabulated forms.Out of 100 participants responding to the request for participation, gender-wise, 45% of the participants were male while 55% of the participants were females. Demographically, 50% participants lived in rural, 35% in urban while 15% participants lived in suburban areas. Educational background of the participants ranged from High school pass-outs to Graduates.Participants were aware about the zoonotic potential of leptospirosis, giardiasis, rabies, hookworms, coccidiosis, lyme disease, roundworms, toxoplasma, leishmaniasis, salmonellosis and ringworm disease. Knowledge gaps in the sampled population, in terms of lack of awareness about zoonotic diseases vectored by mosquitoes, ticks and fleas; practice of not doing regular deworming and prophylactic control of fleas and ticks on pet dogs; and lack of practice among physicians to discuss zoonotic canine diseases with their clients were revealed by this study.

VA comparative study on menstrual hygiene among urban and rural adolescent girls of west bengal.
p3147
aVMenstruation is a normal physiological process to the females but sometimes it is considered as unclean phenomenon in the society.To compare the perceptions of different aspects of menstrual hygiene between adolescent girls of rural and urban area.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2013 to September 2013 in urban and rural area of South 24, Paraganas, West Bengal among 541 adolescent school girls in the age group of 13-18 years. Data were collected by the predesigned and pretested questionnaires.Only 37.52% girls were aware of menstruation prior to attainment of menarche. The difference in the awareness regarding menstruation in urban and rural area was highly significant. Only 36% girls in the urban and 54.88% girls in the rural area used homemade sanitary pads and reused the same in the subsequent period. Satisfactory Cleaning of external genitalia was practiced by only 47.63% of the urban and 37.96% of the rural girls. This study found differences in hygienic practices followed by adolescent girls in urban and rural area.Hygienic practices during menstruation were unsatisfactory in the rural area as compared to the urban area. Girls should be educated about the proper hygienic practices as well as bring them out of traditional beliefs, misconceptions, and restrictions regarding menstruation.

VRole of ultrasound with color Doppler in acute scrotum management.
p3150
aVAn acute scrotum is defined as acute pain with or without scrotal swelling, may be accompanied by local signs or general symptoms. Acute scrotal pain is a medical emergency. Depending on cause, the management is entirely different. Torsion of testis and strangulated hernia are surgical emergency; whereas, epididymo-orchitis is treated by medicines. Testicular trauma and obstructed hernia can be differentiated by taking history from patient. Physical examination adds only a little information. Color Doppler ultrasound (US) is the modality of choice to differentiate testicular torsion from inflammatory conditions and can thus help in avoiding unnecessary surgical explorations.A study on 50 patients was conducted who were referred with history of acute scrotal pain to our department between January 2013 and January 2014. Trauma and scrotal mass were excluded from the study. The clinical presentation, outcome, and US results were analyzed.Color Doppler sonography yielded a positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV) of 100% each for torsion, whereas, 93.9 and 70.6% for epididymo-orchitis, respectively; a sensitivity and specificity of 100% for torsion, whereas, for epididymo-orchitis it was found to be 86.1 and 85.7%, respectively. In cases of incomplete or early torsion, some residual perfusion may be detected leading to false-negative results.We therefore conclude that color Doppler sonography can reliably rule out testicular torsion and can thus help in avoiding unnecessary surgical explorations. Hence, it can significantly improve outcome and decrease morbidity of patient. It is an accurate, rapid, nonexpensive, nonionizing, important adjunct to clinical assessment of scrotum.

VPrevalence and correlates of overweight/obesity among adolescents in an urban city of north India.
p3153
aVObesity and overweight is a growing pandemic affecting millions of adolescents in developed as well as developing countries. Obesity is associated with the onset of major chronic diseases leading to complications and also psychosocial problems in adolescents. The greater concern is that the risks of obesity during childhood will persist into adolescence and adulthood. The objectives of the study were to assess the prevalence of being overweight and obesity and to study the associated risk factors.1900 adolescents in the age group of 10-19 years were included in the study. A predesigned and pretested questionnaire which included the variables such as going to school by bus or cycle, eating habits, playing video/computer games or outdoor games and sibling count were recorded. Body weight and height were recorded in subjects for calculating body mass index (BMI). International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) classification was used for the estimation of being overweight and obese.The mean age of the study subjects was 14.84 years (SD = 2.81). Mean weight increased from 34.7 to 55.09 kg from the age group 10-13 to 17-19 years. Mean height also increased from 1.34 to 1.57 m from the age group 10-13 to 17-19 years. Similarly, the mean body mass index was 19.23 at 10-13 years, followed by 21.11 at 14-16 years and 22.46 at 17-19 years. On binary logistic regression analysis, female gender, bus as a mode of transport, not playing games, and single sibling were found to have independent association with prevalence of being overweight.

p3156
aVObesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HTN). In an era of rapidly growing prevalence of obesity, it is important to explore the current knowledge, attitude, and practices of primary care physicians.Study participants were medical officers (MOs) of primary health centers in three districts of North Karnataka. The questionnaire was developed by a review of literature in the field and validated with five participants for scope, length, and clarity.Of the 102 participants, only 15% were aware about the burden of obesity in India. HTN, DM, and CVD were indicated as comorbidities by 73, 78, and 60 participants, respectively. Only 25 and 12 participants indicated appropriate body mass index (BMI) cut-off values for overweight and obesity diagnosis. Of the 102 participants, 54 were not aware of the guidelines for obesity management. Practices and attitudes of the participants were encouraging. Nearly all of them felt that the adults with BMI within the healthy range should be encouraged to maintain their weight and, three-fourth of them agreed that most overweight persons should be treated for weight loss and small weight loss can achieve major medical benefit. However, nearly half of the participants' responses were stereotypical as they felt only obese and overweight with comorbidities should be treated for weight loss. Two-thirds of them use BMI to diagnose overweight/obese and nearly all of them advice their patients to increase physical activity and restrict fat. Most of the participants were advising their patients to restrict sugar intake, increase fruits and vegetable consumption, reduce red meat, and avoid alcohol consumption.Present study exposed the lack of knowledge regarding obesity. However, practices and attitudes of the participants were promising. There is a need of in-service training to MOs to further improve their knowledge and practices towards management of obesity.

p3159
aVWith a high prevalence of diabetes in India, there is a need to study the impact of this disease on the quality of life (QoL) of the patients.This facility-based cross-sectional study assessed the QoL of patients attending the diabetic clinic using the World Health Organization (WHO) QoL BREF instrument in Tamil Nadu. The QoL was analyzed domain-wise and various socio-demographic factors affecting the QoL were studied.The mean total score of the QoL scale was 58.05 (95% CI, 22.18-93.88). Domain-wise, 63% had good physical, 69% had good psychological, 27% had good social and 85% had good environmental QoL scores. Males, currently married and those with BMI more than 25 had a statistically significantly better QoL compared to their counterparts.Diabetes does impair the QoL of patients but not to a great extent. There is a need to specifically target and improve the QoL of women, widowed and separated, and non-obese diabetics who are at risk of a poor QoL. QoL assessment should be routinely practiced in diabetic clinics.

A total of eight hospitals were chosen as the study sample size. Simple random sampling technique was used for the selection of the nonteaching hospitals. A pre-structured and pre-tested interview questionnaire was used to collect necessary information regarding the hospitals and biomedical waste (BMW) management of the hospitals. The general information about the selected hospitals/employees of the hospitals was collected.Mean hospital waste generated in the eight nonteaching hospitals of Lucknow was 0.56 kg/bed/day. About 50.5% of the hospitals did not have BMW department and colored dustbins. In 37.5% of the hospitals, there were no BMW records and segregation at source. Incinerator was used only by hospital A for treatment of BMW. Hospital G and hospital H had no facilities for BMW treatment.There is a need for appropriate training of staffs, strict implementation of rules, and continuous surveillance of the hospitals of Lucknow to improve the BMW management and handling practices.

Coupled with this national scenario, the development of Family medicine as a distinct discipline is in a crucial stage. There is a nation-wide urge to build family medicine training units and service centers across the country to fulfill the unmet health needs of the population.This study aimed to bring out reasons for encounter (RFE) and morbidity pattern of patients seen in a family physician run urban health center in South India.The study was conducted in an urban health center of a tertiary care hospital. Clinicians entered the data using International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) codes. Data included were demographics, 3 RFE, 3 diagnoses, 3 outcomes of care that include prescriptions, investigations, procedures, and referrals made.During 47,590 patient encounters, 59,647 RFE, 62,283 diagnoses and 68269 outcomes of care were recorded. The majority of RFEs and diagnoses are in the following ICPC chapters: Endocrinology (38.6%), cardiovascular (35.91%), respiratory (20.26%), digestive (7.68% and musculo-skeletal (6.8%). The most frequent outcome of care was prescriptions, followed by counseling and nebulization.This study is the first to report on the RFE in India. This study demonstrated the breadth of clinical conditions seen by family physicians across all ages and in both genders. This study attempts to highlight the need for family physician based services as a training ground for trainees.

Pregnancy is a period in which more than 90% women have significant and complex skin changes that may have great impact on the woman's life. The dermatoses of pregnancy represent a heterogeneous group of skin diseases related to pregnancy and/or the postpartum period. The dermatoses of pregnancy can be classified into the following three groups: Physiologic skin changes in pregnancy, pre-existing dermatoses affected by pregnancy, and specific dermatoses of pregnancy. Though most of these skin dermatoses are benign and resolve in postpartum period, a few can risk fetal life and require antenatal surveillance. Most of the dermatoses of pregnancy can be treated conservatively but a few require intervention in the form of termination of pregnancy. Correct diagnosis is essential for the treatment of these disorders. This article discusses the current knowledge of various skin changes during pregnancy and the evaluation of the patient with pregnancy dermatoses with special emphasis on clinical features, diagnostic tests, maternal and fetal prognosis, therapy, and management.

aVIndia plans to roll-out universal health coverage in spite of having one of the lowest governments spending on health in the world. A scenario such as this means that health policy decisions particularly with respect to priority setting and resource allocation are often difficult and riddled with difficult choices. Moreover, a variety of decisions and determinants beyond the barriers of the health system has to be taken into account in a pluralistic and diverse nation like India during the healthy policy making process. The review provides a brief overview on the current policy making scenario, where often decisions are not based on latest research evidence, but on placating powerful activist groups and is more problem oriented rather than being solution oriented. Various opportunities which exist in order to incorporate evidence in order to inform health policy are discussed. The article highlights the need to develop a transparent, inclusive and independent mechanism to prospectively appraise all available evidence and help inform policy-making based on predetermined criteria and to as evaluate the impact of policy decisions thereby helping in knowledge creation, translation as well as its implementation.

ASHAs get cash incentives for six postnatal home visits for newborn care. We studied newborn care practices among mothers in Mewat, Haryana, having a high NMR and determined risk factors for unsafe practices and described the knowledge and skills of ASHAs during home visits.A cross-sectional survey was conducted among mothers who had delivered a child during the previous seven months using cluster sampling. We interviewed mothers and ASHAs in the selected subcentres using semi-structured questionnaires on the six safe newborn care practices, namely safe breastfeeding, keeping cord and eyes clean, wrapping baby, kangaroo care, delayed bathing and hand washing.We interviewed 320 mothers, 61 ASHAs and observed 19 home visits. Overall, 60% of mothers adopted less than three safe practices. Wrapping newborns (96%) and delayed bathing (64%) were better adopted than cord care (49%), safe breastfeeding (48%), hand washing (30%), kangaroo care (20%) and eye care (9%). Cultural beliefs and traditional birth attendants influenced the mother's practices. The lack of supervision by auxiliary nurse midwives (ANM), delayed referral and transportation were the other challenges.Knowledge-practice gaps existed among mothers counselled by ASHAs. Poor utilization of reproductive and child health services decreased opportunities for ASHA-mother dialogue on safe practices. Recommendations included training ANMs, training TBAs as ASHAs, innovative communication strategies for ASHAs and improved referral system.

VEndoscope-assisted intraoral excision of osteochondroma of the mandibular condyle.
p3208
aVOsteochondroma (OC) is one of the most common bony lesions of the skeleton. It is rare in the maxillofacial region and reported infrequently in the literature. This lesion is considered the most common of benign tumors of the temporomandibular joint. It is usually associated with the coronoid, followed by the condyloid process. OC can affect any bone formed from cartilage and can arise spontaneously or as a result of osseous trauma. It usually protrudes from the surface of bone and is covered with cartilage. Most condylar OCs present as progressive limitation of mandibular movements, facial asymmetry, malocclusion, pain, and deviation in mouth opening. Extraoral approaches to the OCs, which are usually located on the medial pole of the condyle, provide ease of accessibility, although there is an inherent likelihood of damage to the facial nerve and scarring. The use of a transoral endoscope-assisted conservative approach for the removal of OCs produces the desired favorable esthetic and functional results.

A null hypothesis was proposed that there is no relation between CVMI and DI.A highly significant association (Pearson's contingency coefficient 0.713 for males and 0.863 for females) was found between DI and CVMI. In males, the DI stage E corresponded to stage 2 of CVMI (pre-peak of pubertal growth spurt) and DI stages F and G corresponded to stages 3 and 4 of CVMI (peak of pubertal growth spurt). DI stage H was associated with stages 5 and 6 of CVMI (end of pubertal growth spurt). In females, the DI stages C, D corresponded to CVMI stages 1, 2; DI stages E, F with CVMI stages 3, 4; DI stages G, H with CVMI stages 5, 6.Mandibular second molar calcification stages can be used as indicators for assessment of skeletal maturity.

VZirconia crowns for rehabilitation of decayed primary incisors: an esthetic alternative.
p3230
aVEsthetic management of extensively decayed primary maxillary anterior teeth requiring full coronal coverage restoration is usually challenging to the pediatric dentists especially in very young children. Many esthetic options have been tried over the years each having its own advantages, disadvantages and associated technical, functional or esthetic limitations. Zirconia crowns have provided a treatment alternative to address the esthetic concerns and ease of placement of extra-coronal restorations on primary anterior teeth. The present article presents a case where grossly decayed maxillary primary incisors were restored esthetically and functionally with ready made zirconia crowns (ZIRKIZ, HASS Corp; Korea). After endodontic treatment the decayed teeth were restored with zirconia crowns. Over a 30 months period, the crowns have demonstrated good retention and esthetic results. Dealing with esthetic needs in children with extensive loss of tooth structure, using Zirconia crowns would be practical and successful. The treatment described is simple and effective and represents a promising alternative for rehabilitation of decayed primary teeth.

aVTo find shortest and reliable time period of urine collection for determination of proteinuria.It is a prospective study carried out on 125 pregnant women with preeclampsia after 20 weeks of gestation having urine albumin >1 using dipstick test. Urine was collected in five different time intervals in colors labeled containers with the assistance of nursing staff; the total collection time was 24 hours. Total urine protein of two-hour, four-hour, eight-hour, 12-hour and 24-hour urine was measured and compared with 24-hour collection. Data was analyzed using the Pearson correlation coefficient.There was significant correlation (p value < 0.01) in two, four, eight and 12-hour urine protein with 24-urine protein, with correlation coefficient of 0.97, 0.97, 0.96 and 0.97, respectively. When a cut off value of 25 mg, 50 mg. 100 mg, and 150 mg for urine protein were used for 2-hour, 4-hours, 8-hour and 12-hour urine collection, a sensitivity of 92.45%, 95.28%, 91.51%, and 96.23% and a specificity of 68.42%, 94.74%, 84.21% and 84.21% were obtained, respectively.Two-hour urine proteins can be used for assessment of proteinuria in preeclampsia instead of gold standard 24-hour urine collection for early diagnosis and better patient compliance.

p3236
aVThis study aimed to assess the anticariogenic and hemolytic activity of crude plant seed protein extracts against tooth decaying bacteria.The proteins from seeds of 12 different plants were extracted and used for antimicrobial assay against six different organisms. The extraction was carried out in 10mM of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Protein concentrations were determined as described by Bradford method. Anticariogenic activity was studied by agar well diffusion method and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) was evaluated by the two-fold serial broth dilution method. Hemolytic activity, treatment of proteinase K and Kinetic study in Mimusops elengi crude seed protein extract.The anticariogenic assay demonstrated the activity of Mimusops elengi against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. A minor activity of Glycine wightii against Streptococcus mutans was also found. The protein content of Mimusops elengi seed protein extract was 5.84mg/ml. The MIC values for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes against Mimusops elengi seed protein extract were 364.36\u03bcg/ml and 182.19\u03bcg/ml, respectively. Kinetic study further elucidated the mode of inhibition in the presence of the Mimusops elengi plant seed protein with respect to time. The concentration of crude extract which gave 50% hemolysis compared to Triton X-100 treatment (HC50) value was 1.58 mg/ml; which is more than five times larger than that of the MIC. Treatment with proteinase K of the Mimusops elengi seed protein resulted in absence of the inhibition zone; which clearly indicates that the activity was only due to protein.Our results showed the prominence of Mimusops elengi plant seed protein extract as an effective herbal medication against tooth decaying bacteria.

VCausality of injury and outcome in patients admitted in a major trauma center in North India.
p3241
aVTrauma in South Asia is an increasingly significant problem, particularly in light of increasing motorization. Societal changes are resulting in alterations in the epidemiology of trauma.To assess various epidemiological parameters that influence causation of injury in the patients admitted in a major trauma center in Northern India.Prospective, cross-sectional, Hospital based study from August 2008 to July 2009.A prospective study of 748 patients chosen by random assortment was carried out over a period of 1 year (August 2008 to July 2009) and following parameters were noted: Age group, sex, mode of trauma, type of injury, place where the trauma occurred and factors leading to injury. The length of stay of patients, Kampala trauma score (KTS) and mortality depending on the arrival time in emergency department was also noted.Data analysis was performed using SPSS Version 16.Overall trauma was most common in the age group 15-30 years (Mean age: 29.43 ± 16.87 years), with male constituting 85.29% of the total patients. It was observed that road side injuries were the most frequent (66.71%) site of injuries, whereas household injuries (23.66%), farm site (6.28%), work place (1.60) were the next most common modes of trauma. Mean time of presentation of injured patient was 2.53 ± 4.92 days. About 48.13% patients were admitted after more than 24 h after the injury. Two wheelers (32.09) were found to be the most common mode of injury. Maximum injuries (65.31%) occurred in the rural setting. The overall length of hospital stay ranged from 2 days to 178 days (median15.6 days). Mortality is more in patients who arrive in night (between 9 pm and 5 pm).We conclude that the majority of injuries are preventable and the epidemiological trends differ from that of developed countries. Therefore, preventive strategies should be made on the basis of these epidemiological trends.

Demographic variables and information on prehospital care, time and mechanism of injury, mode of transport to EDs, and primary hospital resuscitation were abstracted and analyzed.Of the 113 injured patients in this study, 42 had TBI and died within 24 h of ED admission. All of these TBI patients were transported to the ED by relatives or bystanders in non-ambulance vehicles. Most of the patients with TBI (78.5%) were 21-50-years-old; and overall 90.0% were males. Persons working near or along busy roads struck by vehicles accounted for 80.9% of all TBI cases. Severe TBIs were present in 97.6% of the patients; of these, 92.8% had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3 on arrival. Other concurrent injuries included superficial lacerations (85.7%), facial injuries (57.1%), and upper (35.7%) and lower (30.9%) extremity fractures. Common lesions recognized on computed tomography (CT) scan were acute subdural hematoma (21.4%), subarachnoid hemorrhage with diffuse cerebral edema (16.6%), and skull base fracture with diffuse cerebral edema (14.2%); in 21.4% of cases, the CT scan were reported normal.Most of the TBI patients who died within 24 h after admission to EDs in this study were not transported to EDs in emergency medical vehicles; most were of working age (ages 20-50 years); were male; and were day laborers working on busy interstate roads where they were hit by vehicles.

VA Multi Factorial Analysis of the epidemiology of Injuries from Falls from Heights.
p3247
aVFall from height is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in suburban population in India. These cases are either domestic or workplace injuries with different causative factors. We analyzed different aspects of these falls to identify their risk factors.We conducted prospective and retrospective epidemiological study to identify various causative, contributory factors, and resultant injuries in cases of fall from height. The study group comprised of semiurban population and involved both domestic and workplace injuries presenting to a tertiary care hospital.There were 208 cases of workplace (112) and domestic (96) fall from height. In domestic cases absence of parapet on roof was the commonest cause, most of falls occurred during summer and rainy season. Alcohol consumption prior to fall was commonest associated factor in adult males. Children mostly fell while playing on roof and climbing trees. Among workplace cases, civil construction site injuries were commonest and absence of any protective gear and long working and evening hours were commonest associated factors. Mean injury severity score was 10.86 in domestic cases and 14.87 in workplace cases. There were 17 mortalities with head injury being commonest associated cause. Only difference in incidence of alcohol consumption and permanent disability was statistically significant between workplace and domestic falls.Different factors are responsible for domestic and workplace cases of fall from height. Most of these cases are potentially preventable.

He had history of birth asphyxia and acquired HIV infection from his father when the same syringe and needle was used on both of them in a medical setting where the father and son had consulted for treatment of pyrexia of unknown origin. He was the eldest of a three children family in which the biologic father had acquired HIV through extramarital sexual contact with HIV-infected sex workers but was unaware of his HIV positive status till our patient, the 16-year-old was admitted and treated for pulmonary tuberculosis at 14 years of age. The boy's mother had only acquired HIV after having three children with the HIV-positive husband, thus leaving the other two children HIV negative. The catatonia completely resolved within 2 days after the ART was withheld, and risperidone 1 mg twice a day was prescribed. This case highlights the risks of ART and breach of universal precautions.

We discuss our experience with five children suffering from this pathology and their surgical management carried at our institution from 2007 to 2013. The genesis in pediatric patients is, usually, spontaneous in contrast with the history of trauma seen in adults. Clinical symptoms, usually, range from an asymptomatic lesion, local discomfort, headaches to necrosis and massive hemorrhage. Selective angiography remains the cornerstone for investigation. Complete surgical excision, embolization or an approach combining the modalities is curative.

The lesion is often mistaken with angiosarcoma and a group of other benign and malignant vascular lesions. The clinical and radiological findings are not specific, and the diagnosis is based on the histological examination. Intracranial lesions are extremely rare with only 32 cases been reported in the literature. Only two cases of IPEH presenting as scalp swelling have been reported in the literature. We report a case of a 3-month-old boy with IPEH of scalp in the left parietal region, which was involving the skull bone and extending intracranially.

p3283
aVSplit cord malformations (SCM) are a common pediatric abnormality where children present with features of tethering and backache along with varying neurological deficits. Multiple neural tube defects may co-exist in children having defects of primary and/or secondary neurulation. Co-existent neurenteric cysts along with type 1 SCM have been described very rarely in the literature. We report a case of silent neurenteric cyst at conus medullaris with SCM type 1 where the cyst was missed in the preoperative imaging. Until date, only 8 such cases of neurenteric cysts with SCM at lumbar region have been reported. We review the literature regarding co-existing dual pathologies of neurenteric cysts and type 1 SCMs in light of limited capacity of imaging modalities to detect small neurenteric cysts in presence of co-existent neural tube defects. Multiple spinal neural tube defects in children need more attention and precise microneurosurgical skills as management differs in each of them. Co-existence of such pathologies detected intra-operatively may need modifications in preoperative planning to achieve the best possible outcomes.

For estimating test-retest reliability, FSST was done by principal investigator twice and Inter-rater reliability was assessed by principal investigator and second investigator with an interval of 7 days. FRT was used as the criterion dynamic balance measure to validate FSST. The data was tabulated and analysed statistically.The test-retest reliability and inter-rater reliability of FSST are ICC(1,1) = 0.70 (0.64-0.90) and ICC(2,1) = 0.78 (0.62-0.91) respectively. The Bland-Altman limits of agreement were also satisfied.

aVTumors of the central nervous system (CNS) are the second most frequent malignancy of childhood and the most common solid tumor in this age group. CNS tumors represent approximately 17% of all malignancies in the pediatric age range, including adolescents. Glial neoplasms in children account for up to 60% of supratentorial intraaxial tumors. Their histological distribution and prognostic features differ from that of adults.To study clinical and pathological characteristics, and to analyze the outcome using the Engel's classification for seizures, Karnofsky's score during the available follow-up period of minimum 1 year following the surgical and adjuvant therapy of supratentorial intraaxial extraventricular primary pediatric (SIEPP) brain tumors in children equal or less than 18 years.The study design is a prospective study done in NIMS from October 2008 to January 2012. All the patients less than 18 years of age operated for SIEPP brain tumors proven histopathologically were included in the study. All the patients with recurrent or residual primary tumors or secondaries were excluded from the study. Post operative CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is done following surgery.There were 2, 8 and 20 patients in the age range of 0-2 years, >2-10 years and 10-18 years, respectively. There were 21 male patients and 9 female patients. Out of 30 patients, 16 had lesion in the temporal lobe, 6 in frontal lobe, 4 in thalamus, 3 in parietal lobe and 1 in occipital lobe. Out of 30 patients, 11 patients had malignant lesions and nineteen patients had benign lesions. Gross total excision could be achieved in 19 patients and subtotal in 11 patients. Seven patients had mortality and four of the remaining 23 patients had increased deficits postoperatively. Remaining 19 patients either improved or remained same.SIEPP brain tumors have male preponderance, occur in 95% of patients in the age range of 7-18 years and have temporal lobe as the most common site of origin. The seizure presentation has good outcome compared to raised intracranial pressure features. The seizure control is quite good irrespective of subtotal or gross total excision in temporal lobe low grade tumors. All PNETs have survival of less than 1 year even with adjuvant chemo and radiotherapy.

VAnuvasan Basti in escalating dose is an alternative for Snehapana before Vamana and Virechana: Trends from a pilot study.
p3297
aVOral administration of medicated fats (oil or ghee) is termed as Snehapana. It is an essential step before Vamana (therapeutic emesis) and Virechana (therapeutic purgation). Ayurveda physicians often experience a poor compliance in 10-15% patients for oral administration of medicated fats especially in escalating doses. Incomplete Snehapana sometimes creates a problem for a physician to prepare the patient for these processes. These inconveniences made us think about effective alternatives to counter drawbacks and improve acceptance of Snehapana. The present study was planned to assess the efficacy of Anuvasana Basti (oil enema) in escalating doses as an alternative for Snehapana. Anuvasana Basti of medicated sesame oil with rock salt was administered in 10 patients for three to seven days till they showed signs and symptoms of complete Snehana. The symptoms of Snehana like semisolid or loose stools, feeling exhausted without much exertion, lightness of body and oiliness of skin were observed. Though the Snehana symptoms varied in intensity, they were similar as they are produced after oral administration of fats. This trend suggests Anuvasana Basti in escalating dose is an alternative for Snehapana before administration of Shodhana therapy like Vamana or Virechana.

Warts, vis-a-vis Charmakila, in Ayurvedic classical texts are classified into different types depending on the dominance of dosha. Ayurveda prescribes oral medications, topical use of Kshara (alkaline ash of herbs), Agni (thermal cautery) and Shastrakarma (surgery) for removal of Charmakila. Use of topical Kshara in the form of powder, aqueous solution i.e. Ksharodaka and Ksharasutra (thread smeared with Kshara) for warts has been reported. However, these methods necessitate multiple sittings and takea longer duration for removal of the warts. Herewith, we report a case series of different types of warts treated with intralesional infiltration of Apamarga Ksharodaka (AK), i.e. aqueous solution of Apamarga (Achyranthes aspera) Kshara.

Observations during our clinical experience and pilot studies on Laghu shankha prakshalana kriya (LSP), a yogic bowel cleansing technique, appeared to be safe and complimentary.To test the safety and effectiveness of LSP in patients with essential hypertension.This self control study recruited 32 patients with mild to moderate essential HTN admitted for a week long residential integrated yoga therapy program at the integrative health home in Bengaluru. Patients had a daily routine of 6 hours of integrated approach of yoga therapy (IAYT) module for HTN that included physical postures, relaxation sessions, pranayama and meditations. LSP, an additional practice, that involved drinking of luke-warm water (with or without a herbal combination, triphala) followed by a set of specific yoga postures that activates defecation reflex, was administered on 2(nd) (LSP without triphala) and 5(th) day (LSP with triphala). Assessments (sitting blood pressure and pulse rate) were done just before and after both the sessions of LSP. Secondary outcome measures such as body mass index (BMI), symptom scores, medication scores, fatigue, state and trait anxiety, general health and quality of life were assessed on 1(st) and 6(th) day of IAYT intervention.There was significant (P < 0.001, paired t test) reduction in blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and pulse rate immediately after both the sessions (LSP with and without triphala). There were no adverse effects reported during or after LSP. There was no significant difference between the two techniques (P < 0.505, independent samples t test), although the percentage change appeared to be higher after triphala LSP session. The number of visits to clear the bowel during the procedure was significantly (P < 0.001, independent samples t test) higher after LSP with triphala than LSP without triphal\u0101. After weeklong IAYT, there were significant reductions in blood pressure (P < 0.001), BMI (P < 0.004), medication score (P < 0.001), symptoms score (P < 0.001), fatigue (P < 0.001), state and trait anxiety (STAI, P < 0.001), scores of general ill health (GHQ, P < 0.001), and increase in comfort level (P < 0.001) and quality of sleep (P < 0.001).LSP (a part of IAYT) is a safe and useful procedure for patients with essential hypertension. LSP with triphala is more useful.

Study was carried out in Maxwell public school, Bangalore. The scale was administered on parents of children of the age group 6-12 years. CPQ was administered on children of the age group 8-12 years.The ACPI was associated with excellent internal consistency. The Cronbach's alpha for A, B, and C scales were 0.77, 0.55, and 0.84, respectively, and the Split-half reliability scores were 0.66.0.39 and 0.84, respectively. Factor validity coefficient scores on each items was above 0.5. Scores on vataja, pittaja and kaphaja scales were inversely correlated. Items of V, P, and K scales showed significant correlation (values ranging from 0.39 to 0.84) with subscales of CPQ, which indicates that Eastern and Western psychology concept have good correspondence.The prakrti of the children can be measured consistently by this instrument. Scores on V and P scale showed good correlation with the anxiety primary scale of CPQ.

aVTransverse vaginal septum is a result of faulty canalization of embryonic vagina. Septum may be complete but usually has laterally placed tiny hole giving an impression of vaginal vault without cervix. We described a case of untreated transverse vaginal septum with small central aperture diagnosed during labor and unicornuate uterus diagnosed intraoperatively, with successful pregnancy outcome.

VCustom fabricated acrylic vaginal stent as an adjunct to surgical creation of neovagina for a young female with isolated vaginal agenesis.
p3315
aVVaginal agenesis is one of the major congenital anomalies of the female genital tract. It may present either as an isolated developmental defect or within a complex of more extensive anomalies. Most commonly it is associated with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. The correction of vaginal agenesis requires the creation of a neovaginal cavity that is dissected between the bladder and the rectum. After reconstruction of space for vagina surgically, a long-term vaginal stent use is required to maintain vaginal width and depth and to prevent contraction. In this article is presented a case of nonsyndromic agenesis of vagina in a 14-year-old girl and its surgical management using custom fabricated acrylic vaginal stent.

VPrimary umbilical endometriosis: A rarity.
p3318
aVEndometriosis is a functional endometrial tissue found outside the normal uterine cavity. Primary umbilical endometriosis is defined as the presence of ectopic endometrial glands and stroma within umbilicus, without prior history of pelvic endometriosis. It is a rare presentation in all cases of endometriosis, especially in Asians. Here, a case of primary umbilical endometriosis has been reported in a 33-year-old nulliparous female who presented with the history of cyclical bleeding and pain in an umbilical mass during menstrual cycle. Athough the disease is rare, umbilical endometriosis should be taken into account in differential diagnosis of umbilical disorders even in young nulliparous women with no typical symptoms of pelvic endometriosis. The disease pathogenesis, its symptoms, and treatment modality have been discussed.

VOrlistat in polycystic ovarian syndrome reduces weight with improvement in lipid profile and pregnancy rates.
p3321
aVThe effects of exercise, metformin, and orlistat on anthropometric parameters, lipid profile, endocrine parameters, and ovulation in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) women were compared.The aim was to study the efficacy of orlistat compared with metformin and exercise in PCOS.Randomized control trial.A total of 90 eligible PCOS women were randomly assigned to receive either of the two drugs (orlistat or metformin) in combination with lifestyle interventions or as controls where they received lifestyle interventions alone. Anthropometric parameters were assessed at baseline and 4 weekly intervals for 3 months. Androgen levels, insulin resistance, ovulation and conception rates and lipid profile were also assessed at the end of study.Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 17.0.The levels of fasting blood sugar, fasting insulin and homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance were comparable in three treatment groups. Mean total testosterone, serum hormone binding globulin, free androgen index, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in all arms were comparable and statistically nonsignificant. However, orlistat and metformin were more effective in reducing weight, body mass index, waist circumference and waist-hip ratio. However, side-effects were less with orlistat. Ovulation rate was 33.3%, 23.35% with orlistat and metformin group respectively, but were not statistically significant. In orlistat group, significant improvement was observed in lipid profile at the end of 3 months. Conception rates were 40% and 16.7% and 3.3% in orlistat, metformin group and control group respectively (P - 0.003). Weight loss was found to be the best predictor of ovulation with sensitivity with good sensitivity.Orlistat is as effective as metformin in reducing weight and achieves similar ovulation rates in obese PCOS patients. However, orlistat has minimal side-effects and is better tolerated compared with metformin.

VSurvey of reasons for discontinuation from in vitro fertilization treatment among couples attending infertility clinic.
p3324
aVWith the increase in infertility burden, more and more couples are opting for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Despite the availability of various treatment options, the major concern that needs to be addressed is the reasons why such couples, initially motivated so strongly, drop out in fairly high numbers from IVF cycles. With this point of view the study was designed.The objective of this study was to explore the reasons why couples discontinue fertility treatment.This retrospective study was carried out among couples in the age group of 20-40 years who opted for IVF at Tertiary care hospital and a private infertility center.Medical records for 3 years (2009-2012) were taken out and included in the study for analysis. Socio-demographic details along with indication for IVF and reasons for drop-separate IVF therapy were recorded on case record form and were analyzed.Twenty-one percent of the patients had tubal pathology, thus making it the commonest female related factor for indication of IVF. Oligoasthenospermia (13%) was the commonest cause of male related infertility factor. Financial burden was the primary cause for terminating treatment in majority of the IVF cases.Financial burden (62.5%) was the commonest reason for drop out among couples from IVF cycle.

VGonadotrophins: The future.
p3327
aVThe role of the IVF clinician is to make the ART treatment safe, patient-friendly, cost effective and at the same time offer good and high quality treatment. IVF protocols are a burden for women and are one of the potential reasons why women don't return for subsequent cycles. Frequent injections may increase stress and also result in high error rates. Simple short treatment regimen with optimal recovery of good quality oocytes results in development of good quality embryos followed by SET in treatment and cryopreservation cycles are a less burden and result in related lesser discontinuation, side effects, treatment cycles in time and are more cost-effective. Development of FSH analogues with longer terminal t1/2 and slower absorption to peak serum levels will increase the efficiency, decrease the side effects and also is easy to administer. This makes it convenient for the patients increasing the compliance. A certain minimum LH concentration is necessary for adequate thecal cell function and subsequent oestradiol synthesis in the granulosa cells. Adjuvant r-HLH gives clinician's precise control over the dose of LH bioactivity administered to target the therapeutic window. New parenteral, transdermal, inhaled and oral fertility drugs and regimens are currently under research and development with the objective to further simplify treatment for ART.

VScheduling cycles with gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist protocol in in vitro fertilization: Is there a scope in batch in vitro fertilization?
p3330
aVIn India, a practice of "Batch in vitro fertilization (IVF)" has evolved in many infertility centers in an effort to align infertility management with logistics. A "Batch IVF" is an approach where the menstrual cycles of multiple women are programmed, such that they can undergo all the processes; from stimulation until embryo transfer about the same time. In "Batch IVF", the day for initiating stimulation is calculated retrospectively from the day the visiting embryologist is available at the clinic (day of ovum pick-up). Aligning the cycles of multiple women with steroids followed by down regulation with long gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-A) is one of the currently employed methods for batching. There is sufficient evidence on scheduling cycles with steroids in GnRH-An protocol without compromising on the outcome. The objective of this paper is to provide evidence-based clinical concept on scheduling cycles in "Batch IVF" setup with GnRH-An protocol through literature review.

VPrognostic and predictive factors in gingivo buccal complex squamous cell carcinoma: role of tumor budding and pattern of invasion.
p3333
aVInvasive tumor front (ITF) is the deepest three to six cell layers or detached tumor cell groups at the advancing edge of the tumor. Tumor budding is defined as presence of isolated single cells or small cell clusters scattered in the stroma ahead of the ITF and is characteristic of aggressive cancer. It is recognized as an adverse prognostic factor in several human cancers like colorectal, oesophageal, laryngeal cancers and more recently tongue cancers. However, the prognostic value of tumor budding has not been reported in GBCSCC. The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of pattern of invasion (POI) at the ITF, Tumor budding and other clinicopathological parameters in predicting nodal metastases and prognosis in GBCSCC. 33 patients with primary GBCSCC were prospectively evaluated at a tertiary care referral centre. Tumor budding and type of POI was examined in detail and data documented. Statistical analyses were carried out to assess the correlation of tumor budding, POI, and other clinicopathologic parameters (stage, grade of the tumor, tumor thickness, PNI, LVI) with nodal metastases and predict prognosis. Cox regression was used for both Univariate and multivariate analysis. Significant predictors of nodal metastases on Univariate analysis were male gender (p = 0.021), smoking (p = 0.046), Tumor budding (p = 0.014) and diffuse infiltrative/worst POI (p = 0.004), where as on multivariate analysis only worst POI was significantly associated with positive lymph nodes (p = 0.004). Presence of nodal metastases (p = 0.01) and tumor thickness >5 mm (p = 0.009) were independent negative prognostic factors on multivariate analysis. Significant single risk factor predictive of positive lymph nodes is worst POI in GBCSCC. Nodal metastases and >5 mm tumor thickness are independent risk factors for disease free survival.

VPre-decannulation Peristomal Findings in Tracheostomized Cases and Their Effect on the Success of Decannulation.
p3336
aVDecannulating a patient on a tracheostomy is a procedure that has to be dealt with vigilantly. This study evaluated both external and telescopic/bronchoscopic findings at the peristomal level of subjects being considered for decannulation. The patients did not undergo any intervention after above observations and before attempting decannulation. Thereafter peristomal findings and their contribution towards failure to decannulate were correlated. Thirty subjects were studied prospectively, of whom 21 (70 %) demonstrated peristomal complications including granulation tissue, ulceration, mucopurulent discharge, suprastomal granulations, suprastomal collapse and suprastomal flap. Complications were more common in the younger age group (p = 0.007) as well as in tracheostomies of longer duration with mean duration >20 months (p = 0.045). However there was no statistically significant correlation between the success of decannulation and various peristomal findings. Therefore the success of decannulation in a particular case cannot always be correctly predicted by peristomal assessment.

p3339
aVComplex anatomy of oral cavity makes it difficult for a surgeon to assess margins of oral cancer accurately and positive margins compromise loco regional disease control, thus surgeon may rely on frozen section assessment for marginal status. We discussed the prognostic value of frozen section in early carcinoma of oral cavity. 90 patients with pT1 and pT2 oral cavity cancer operated from January 2010 to December 2011 under single consultant surgeon were retrospectively evaluated. Log rank test and multivariate cox regression model was used for testing frozen section against the survival and recurrence free status. Survival of patients with positive or negative frozen section was significant (p = 0.037), Survival of patients with positive or negative histology report was significant (p = 0.004), however; prognosis of patients with positive margins despite revision under frozen control was poorer to the patients with negative margin. Frozen section assessment is accurate but their use in the surgery of oral cavity cancer might not improve loco regional disease control or survival when used routinely.

Variation in the origin of the facial artery was observed on two sides out of 60 sides in 30 cadavers. Facial artery was observed originating at the level just below the maxillary artery within the parotid gland. Facial artery may originate as linguo-facial trunk or thyro-linguo-facial trunk. Other developmental variations have also been described in the literature like, agenesis of facial artery, enlarged facial artery, hypoplastic facial artery. Variability in situation may complicate the surgery. Therefore maxillofacial surgeon, plastic surgeons and head & neck surgeon should be aware of such variation.

Two hundred and fourteen patients who satisfied our criteria were recognized and they were randomly alienated into three groups A, B, C. Group A patients were advised to instill clotrimazole ear drops by themselves. Miconazole cream instillation were done by our trained personal in group B patients. Group C patients were advised to use fluconazole ear drops. Patients were educated to keep ear dry and instructed to come for evaluation in first and second week after initial visit. A randomized double blinded prospective study. In the first week, clotrimazole had a good response than miconazole and fluconazole in our patients and in the second week, our patients showed a drastic response in patients instilling flucanozole ear drops compared to those using micanozole and clotrimazole. This better outcome doesn't show statistical significance since p value is 0.882. Clotrimazole drops, miconazole cream and Fluconazole drops showed almost same therapeutic efficacy in Otomycosis.

p3354
aVInferior turbinate hypertrophy is one of the major causes of nasal airway obstruction. Medical treatment often produces insufficient improvement. In these cases, surgical reduction of inferior turbinate can be proposed. Many different techniques are currently available. The aim of our study is to prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of three techniques i.e., electrocautery, cryotherapy and radiofrequency by comparing the response of patients to these three surgical modalities of turbinate reduction. A total of 90 patients presenting with nasal obstruction with or without allergic symptoms, fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria, attending ENT OPD are included in the study. A prospective study was conducted on three groups of thirty patients with symptoms and signs of nasal obstruction associated with inferior turbinate hypertrophy of more than 3 months duration. Then the percentage of subjective improvement in nasal airway is used to assess treatment outcomes 1week, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after surgery. At the end of 12 months, 56.6 % of patients treated with electrocautery and 56.6 % of patients treated with cryotherapy showed 75 % improvement in nasal obstruction whereas 59.99 % of patients treated with radiofrequency showed 100 % improvement. No statistical difference in the amount of improvement in nasal obstruction was noted between the three treatment groups at the end of 12 months because of relatively small sample size. But clinically radiofrequency showed better subjective improvement in nasal obstruction when compared to cryotherapy and electrocautery.

aVEsophageal cancer is a morbid disease with a grim prognosis. The outcomes of treatment even in non-metastatic disease undergoing potentially curative surgery are poor with 5-year survival ranging from 20 to 35 %. Several multimodality treatment options have been investigated in well-conducted randomised trials and meta-analyses evaluating both neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies. However, there is still lack of uniform practice in the management of operable esophageal cancer. We review the current evidence for multimodality treatment of esophageal cancer, critically analysing the evidence supporting the use of each strategy, the pros and cons of each approach and discuss our approach in management. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy are currently the standard of care in localised esophageal cancer.

VRole of cytokines and Toll-like receptors in the immunopathogenesis of Guillain-Barré syndrome.
p3360
aVGuillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system, mostly triggered by an aberrant immune response to an infectious pathogen. Although several infections have been implicated in the pathogenesis of GBS, not all such infected individuals develop this disease. Moreover, infection with a single agent might also lead to different subtypes of GBS emphasizing the role of host factors in the development of GBS. The host factors regulate a broad range of inflammatory processes that are involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases including GBS. Evidences suggest that systemically and locally released cytokines and their involvement in immune-mediated demyelination and axonal damage of peripheral nerves are important in the pathogenesis of GBS. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) link innate and adaptive immunity through transcription of several proinflammatory cytokines. TLR genes may increase susceptibility to microbial infections; an attenuated immune response towards antigen and downregulation of cytokines occurs due to mutation in the gene. Herein, we discuss the crucial role of host factors such as cytokines and TLRs that activate the immune response and are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.

aVThe service setting has some unique strengths and weaknesses that must be kept in mind when organizing Hospital acquired infections (HAI) prevention interventions.Following an initial study to gather data regarding HAI in the Surgical intensive care unit (ICU) we put into place various infection control interventions. The present study was carried out to analyse the effect of these interventions on the incidence of HAI in the ICU.The total admissions to the ICU were 253 patients. Eighty eight patients (34.78%) were admitted for more than 48 hr, 165 patients stayed for less than 48 h. The frequency of HAI was 7.95% (95% CI 3.54, 15). Hospital acquired pneumonia was observed in 2 of the 88 patients (2.27%) (95% CI 0.38, 7.30) which amounted to 9.70 infections per 1000 ventilator days. Bloodstream infection was detected in 3 out of 88 patients (3.4%) (95% CI 0.87, 8.99) amounting to 6.54 fresh infections per 1000 Central Venous Catheter days. Urinary tract infection was observed in 2 (2.27%) (95% CI 0.38, 7.30) at 2.86 fresh infections per 1000 catheter days. As compared to the previous study we found that there was a decline of HAI ranging from 60 to 70%.Our study demonstrated that by meticulously following infection control protocols especially tailored to the service setting the incidence of HAI's can be reduced. However, the challenge is in maintaining the gains achieved since there is a rapid turnover of manpower in the ICU and a lack of a structured ICU design model.

aVThe modern system of medicine has evolved into a complex, sophisticated and expensive treatment modality in terms of cost of medicines and consumables. In any hospital, approximately 33% of total annual budget is spent on buying materials and supplies including medicines. ABC (Always, Better Control)-VED (Vital, Essential, Desirable) analysis of medical stores of a large teaching, tertiary care hospital of the Armed Forces was carried out to identify the categories of drugs needing focused managerial control.Annual consumption and expenditure data of expendable medical stores for one year was extracted from the drug expense book, followed by classification on its annual usage value. Subsequently, the factor of criticality was applied to arrive at a decision matrix for understanding the need for selective managerial control.The study revealed that out of 1536 items considered for the study, 6.77% (104), 19.27% (296) and 73.95% (1136) items were found to be A, B and C category items respectively. VED analysis revealed that vital items (V) accounted for 13.14% (201), essential items (E) for 56.37% (866) and desirable accounted for 30.49% items (469). ABC-VED matrix analysis of the inventory reveals that only 322 (21%) items out of an inventory of 1536 drugs belonging to category I will require maximum attention.Scientific inventory management tools need to be applied routinely for efficient management of medical stores, as it contributes to judicious use of limited resources and resultant improvement in patient care.

Similarly 72, 159, and 265 species specific genes were identified in L. (L.) donovani when compared to Leishmania (L.) major, Leishmania (L.) mexicana and Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis respectively. The cross comparison of L. (L.) donovani in parallel with the other sequenced species of leishmanial led to the identification of 55 genes which are highly specific and expressed exclusively in L. (L.) donovani. We found mainly the discrepancies of surface proteins such as amastins, proteases, and peptidases. Also 415 repeat containing proteins in L. (L.) donovani and their differential distribution in other leishmanial species were identified which might have a potential role during pathogenesis. The genes identified can be evaluated as drug targets for anti-leishmanial treatment, exploring the scope for extensive future investigations.

aVRecent studies from East Asia and Canadian National Collection of Insects have established the utility of DNA barcoding technique in identification of true bugs. The present study is an expansion of the database by adding mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (mtCOI) sequences from forty three species of indigenous true bugs of India. mtCOI gene analysis of infraorder Pentatomomorpha covering a total of seventy three species that belong to five superfamilies; Pentatomoidea, Coreoidea, Pyrrhocoroidea, Lygaeoidea and Aradoidea revealed more than 3% interspecific distances in all the taxa studied except for two cases which showed barcode sharing. Less than 2% intra-specific divergence was observed in 97% of the taxa analysed and the average interspecies genetic distance was about 29 times higher than the average intraspecies genetic divergence. Distinct sequence divergence pattern at generic level and NJ clustering analysis suggests that COI barcode is an excellent molecular marker for species level identification of unknown taxa; however it may not be useful for resolving deep levels of divergence. Species identification even at nymphal stage could be achieved confirming the efficacy of this technique.

aVThe compilation of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in viruses and its analysis with reference to incidence, distribution and variation would be instrumental in understanding the functional and evolutionary aspects of repeat sequences. Present study encompasses the analysis of SSRs across 30 species of alphaviruses. The full length genome sequences, assessed from NCBI were used for extraction and analysis of repeat sequences using IMEx software. The repeats of different motif sizes (mono- to penta-nucleotide) observed therein exhibited variable incidence across the species. Expectedly, mononucleotide A/T was the most prevalent followed by dinucleotide AG/GA and trinucleotide AAG/GAA in these genomes. The conversion of SSRs to imperfect microsatellite or compound microsatellite (cSSR) is low. cSSR, primarily constituted by variant motifs accounted for up to 12.5% of the SSRs. Interestingly, seven species lacked cSSR in their genomes. However, the SSR and cSSR are predominantly localized to the coding region ORFs for non structural protein and structural proteins. The relative frequencies of different classes of simple and compound microsatellites within and across genomes have been highlighted.

The PCR studies revealed that ACE 'II' (OR = 2.055; p = 0.004) genotype and 'I' (OR = 1.411; p = 0.018) alleles were significantly associated with IS patients. Gender specific analysis revealed a strong association of 'II' (OR = 2.044; p = 0.014) genotype and 'I' (OR = 1.531; p = 0.011) allele with male sex. Classification of patients based on TOAST criteria, revealed a significant association for 'II' genotype (OR = 1.713; p = 0.043) and 'I' (OR = 1.382; p = 0.039) allele in LVD patients only. When the data was stratified based on age and sex, a statistically significant association was observed for ACE 'II' genotype (OR = 2.288; p = 0.006) and 'I' allele (OR = 1.395; p = 0.054) in IS male patients of > 50 years of age. The ACE 'D' allele was found to be increased in controls (OR = 0.709; p = 0.018) than IS patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that smoking and diabetes were the most powerful independent risk factor in LVD type of stroke. Thus, we presented here an evidence for a strong association of ACE 'II' genotype and 'I' allele compounded by factors such as smoking and diabetes among south Indian IS patients.

VAssociation of Versican (VCAN) gene polymorphisms rs251124 and rs2287926 (G428D), with intracranial aneurysm.
p3387
aVIntracranial aneurysm (IA) accounts for 85% of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) and is mainly caused due to the weakening of arterial wall. The structural integrity of the intracranial arteries is mainly influenced by the extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. The Proteoglycan Versican plays an important role in extracellular matrix assembly and plays a major role in the pathogenesis of IA. The linkage studies also indicated VCAN as a putative candidate gene for IA in the 5q22-31 region. Using a case-control study design, we tested the hypothesis whether the variants in VCAN gene, nonsynonymous variants in the coding region of Glycosaminoglycan \u03b1 (GAG-\u03b1) and GAG-\u03b2 and two reported SNPs involved in splicing rs251124 and rs173686 can increase the risk of aSAH among South Indian patients, either independently, or by interacting with other risk factors of the disease. We selected 200 radiologically confirmed aneurysmal cases and 250 ethnically, age and sex matched controls from the Dravidian Malayalam speaking population of South India. The present study reiterated the earlier association of rs251124 with intracranial aneurysm (P = 0.0002) and also found a novel association with rs2287926 (G428D) in exon 7 coding for GAG-\u03b1 with intracranial aneurysm (P = 0.0015). Interestingly, both these SNPs contributed to higher risk for aneurysm in males. In-silico analysis predicted this SNP to have the highest functional relevance in the gene which might have a potentially altered regulatory role in transcription and splicing. Using meta-analysis with available literature rs251124 was found to be the strongest intracranial aneurysm marker for global ethnicities. This study with a novel functional SNP rs2287926 (G428D) further substantiates the potential role of VCAN in the pathogenesis of IA.

Autonomic abnormalities were detected in hand grip test (86.8%), deep breathing test (79.2%), cold pressor test (71.7%), Valsalva maneuver (75.5%), heart rate variability at 30:15 beats after standing (50.9%) and systolic BP on standing (41.5%). Six (16.2%) MSAp and 1 (6.3%) MSAc patients continued to have autonomic symptoms for several months (38.7±26.11, median 36 months) before the appearance of cerebellar (1 patient) or Parkinsonian (6 patients) features.Autonomic dysfunction may be the only presenting feature in some patients with MSA. Routine autonomic testing may help in the early diagnosis of MSA in patients presenting with Parkinsonian or cerebellar features.

VSpinal cord injury without radiological abnormality in adult thoracic spinal trauma.
p3393
aVSpinal cord injury without radiological abnormality (SCIWORA) is a rare entity and usually involves the cervical spine. Thoracic spine involvement is very rare due to the stability provided by the rib cage. The mechanisms of injury and pathophysiology are still debatable.We present a case of an adult male who had road traffic accident and presented with paraplegia. The initial radiological investigations carried out in the emergency department were reported to be normal, however, subsequent magnetic resonance imaging revealed spinal cord contusion without vertebral column disruption. The patient recovered partially with conservative treatment measures including bed rest and methylprednisolone.Spinal trauma patients presenting with neurological deficit but no radiological abnormality should be treated as a case of SCIWORA.

VPlate on plate technique of minimally invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis in distal tibial fractures, an easy and inexpensive method of fracture fixation.
p3396
aVPlate on plate technique can lessen operative time and patient morbidity.This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of minimally invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis (MIPPO) using plate on plate technique of locking plate fixation for closed fractures of distal tibia in a prospective study.Twenty-five patients with distal tibial fractures were treated by MIPPO using locking plate by plate on plate technique. Preoperative variables including age of patient, mode of trauma, type of fracture and soft tissue status were recorded for each patient. Perioperative variables included surgical time and radiation exposure. Postoperative variables included wound status, time to union, return to activity and the American orthopaedic foot and ankle score (AOFAS).All the fractures had united at one year. The average time to union was 16.8 weeks. There were two cases of superficial infection and two cases of deep infection, which required removal of hardware after the fracture was united. The average AO foot and ankle score was 83.6 in our study population.MIPPO using locking plate by plate on plate technique was a safe, effective, inexpensive and easily reproducible method for the treatment of distal tibial fractures in properly selected patients, which minimized operative time and soft tissue morbidity.

p3408
aVSquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the scrotum was one of the first occupational diseases to be described, and acquired its eponym from Sir Percivall Pott. The condition has now become rare owing to the establishment of industrial health norms. A 45-year-old male with a history of long-term exposure to petrochemicals presented to our institution with a scrotal lesion and underwent wide-local excision of the same. Histopathology revealed well-differentiated SCC involving the epididymis. Treatment options included excision with ilio-inguinal bloc dissection (in the event of lymphadenopathy) with subsequent chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Tumors following occupational exposure thus continue to contribute to the rapidly decreasing incidence of scrotal carcinoma.

aVIn India, ragpickers form the base of hierarchy of informal sector of the solid waste management. Assessment of general and gender specific health of women is conducted in this study in view of dearth of published evidence.An interventional study was conducted from October 2003 to April 2005 in Mumbai, at the field office of a nongovernmental organization working for women ragpickers. By the systematic random sampling 168 women ragpickers were selected. Both general and gender-specific health needs of this socially and occupationally marginalized group, including health seeking behavior were explored in this study. Fourteen participants were trained as health volunteers to create awareness in the local community. The data was analyzed by using SPSS version 11.0 software program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).Marriage at young age, multiple pregnancies, low preference toward temporary methods of contraception, high addiction were prevalent in this lower socioeconomic young workforce. Morbidity was statistically significant among ragpickers who collected rags along dumpsite than street side and door to door waste collectors (\u03c7(2) = 27.8; df = 2; P < 0.001 significant). A need-based training program helped to improve knowledge of the participants [z = 12.7 (P < 0.05)].Unfulfilled health needs of this underprivileged workforce who contributes to the ecology and economy of the city need to be addressed. Sensitization of both general public and government is essential to legitimize this occupation. This in turn may help to alleviate poverty and environmental degradation; characteristic of rapid and unplanned urbanization in India.

aVInjuries among welders are an important health issue in metal industries at global level. The study aimed to assess the prevalence and pattern of injuries and its possible associated risk factors among welders.A cross-sectional study was conducted among 209 welders in metal industries of Puducherry, coastal south India. Data regarding all types of injuries during the past 1 year were collected by administering a pre-designed questionnaire. The various risk factors associated with injuries that include age, training before induction, experience, job duration, tobacco chewing, alcohol use and use of protective measures were assessed using standard questionnaire. The data was analyzed by univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis.Majority of subjects were aged between 20 and 40 years (160, 76.6%) and educated below 10(th) standard (181, 86.6%). Mean number of injury was found to be 10.74 (SD = 5.74) in the preceding year. All of them had more than 2 injuries and 44% (92) of them had more than 10 injuries. All of them had abrasions and more than three fourths of them had each of lacerations, foreign body in the eye, flash burns and contusions. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age less than 30 years (OR = 5.19), tobacco use (OR = 2.56), alcohol use (OR = 3.96) and institutional training (OR = 0.10) were the predictors associated with more than 10 injuries among welders.Injury among welders is an important health problem in this area. Strategies for strengthening institutional training for younger age groups may help in decreasing the burden of injuries.

aVThe study was undertaken to examine the relationship between perceived physical and psychological work demands and self reported musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) among workers involved in weaving operations.The Nordic Musculoskeletal Disorders Questionnaire and Work Demands Scale, developed and standardized for the present investigation were the tools for data collection. Chi square test was used to assess univariate associations between work demands and reported MSDs. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed for each of the outcome MSD retaining the variables in the model to adjust for potential confounding.Women were significantly more affected than men in shoulders, wrists/hands, upper back, lower back, and ankle/feet. Perceived physical and psychological demands were significantly associated with MSDs of different body regions. Pulling, pushing, moving, lifting and lowering heavy objects, working while bent or twisted at the waist, and repetitive motions with hands/wrists were the main physical factors retained in the regression models with odds ratios greater than 2. Conflicting demands, work is not remunerative, and no sufficient time to get the job done were the main psychological factors retained in the regression models with odds ratios greater than 1.68. Gender was found to be a significant factor for shoulders, wrists/hands, lower back, and ankles/feet with odds ratios ranging from 1.71 to 2.14. MSDs occurrence was more probable in the mentioned regions among women as compared to men. Both physical and psychological work demands in the work environment were contributing factors for developing MSDs among workers involved in weaving operations.

aVIron is the world's most commonly used metal and can usually be found with other elements in the form of steel. In this era of machines, it is the inevitable part in production of various materials like eyeglass frames, jet aircraft, the space shuttle, automobiles, and surgical instruments. Occupational factors make an important contribution to the global burden of disease, but the reliable data on occupational disease are much more difficult to obtain. Hence, the current study was carried out to find out the morbidity pattern among iron and steel workers.A cross-sectional study. was carried out after obtaining permission from Institutional Ethics Committee in an iron and steel factory. Worker's detailed information regarding profile was taken in pretested questionnaire format after obtaining the informed written consent and explaining the purpose of study. Workers were also interviewed regarding their years of job, job satisfaction, usage of protective devices, and history of injuries during work. Worker's detailed general and systemic examination was conducted.The overall prevalence of morbidities among the workers was 60%. It was observed that commonest morbidity in the workers was lumbago (musculoskeletal pain), that is, 33.25%which was more in Group B (49.73%) than Group A (18.78%), followed by occupational dermatitis (27%) which more common in Group A (33.33%) than Group B (19.79%). It was seen that occupation-related morbidities were more prevalent in Group A, i.e. Exposed group (P < 0.001).It was observed that occupation-related morbidities were more common in exposed group (EG) than that of nonexposed group (NEG) and the difference was found to be statistically significant (P < 0.001).

aVKnown respiratory health effects of exposure to cotton dust are mainly altered pulmonary function findings and symptom of chest tightness. A number of studies have been carried out all over the world to enumerate and evaluate the health effects of cotton dust exposed workers in different processes. However, such studies carried out in ginning industry especially in Indian context are scanty.This study was initiated to explore occupational and morbidity details and respiratory functional status of the exposed workers as well as to investigate across the working shift pulmonary function changes.A cross-sectional study was conducted including workers from ginning units where principal exposure is from cotton dust. All the workers of the selected ginning units were subjected to an interview with a predesigned questionnaire to collect occupational and medical history, clinical examination and pulmonary function test.In this present study, no cross-shift significant change in relation to PEFR and FEV1 values is observed. However, chronic effect on lung function is observed in a few subjects and declining trend of values was observed with increasing job duration as well as age of workers and among smokers. Other health problems among these subjects were backache and joint pain.Studies on cotton textile workers have shown both cross-shift and chronic decline of values. In this study on ginning workers, chronic effect only is observed. This difference of observation may be explained by different nature of exposure in case of ginning. This study recommends regular periodic clinical examination, lung function test and monitoring of dust, gram-negative bacteria and endotoxins in such workplaces.

VDoes occupational health nursing exist in India?
p3426
aVOccupational health services are important to develop healthy and productive work forces, which should be delivered through occupational health team. Occupational health nurse (OHN) is an important member of this team and is required to apply nursing principles in conserving the health of workers in occupational settings.This article attempts to map the occupational health nursing courses in India and design competencies and curriculum for such a course.Information through the Internet, printed journals, and perspectives of the key stakeholders were the principal sources of data.In India, there is a need to initiate a course on occupational health nursing to provide occupational health services for the organized and unorganized sector workforce. A certificate course for occupational health nursing for 3-4 months duration offered through contact session mode can be an opportune beginning. However, to cater employed nurses an online course can be another effective alternative. The theoretical part should essentially include modules on occupational diseases, industrial hygiene, and occupational health legislation, whereas the modules on practical aspects can include visits to industries. Taking into account the existing norms of Indian Factories Act for hazardous units of organized sector an estimated 1,34,640 OHNs are required.There is a need-supply gap in the number of occupational health nursing manpower in India, which can be attributed to the absence of any course to train such manpower.

p3429
aVOccupational stress is common to each and every organization at various levels of hierarchy. The police organization is no exception to this. Rather policing is widely recognized as more stressful than any other occupation, nature of work, irregular duty hours, and many more factors, which can trigger stress. The present study was done to highlight some of these stressful factors in Mumbai police.Simple as well as systematic random sampling technique was adopted to get equal representation from each zone as well as region from Mumbai police. Occupational stress index (OSI) questionnaire was prepared, pilot tested, and validated for screening stress.We screened 276 policemen for occupational stress. Seventy-three percent of them were in the 30-50 years age group, and most of them (49%) studied up to H.S.C. Ninety-one percent were married and 56% had reported duty hours 12-16 h/day. Seventy-one percent were addicted to any of the substance. After screening we found 73% moderately stressed, whereas 18% highly stressed policemen. Sociodemographic factors which were age group (50-58 years), duration of service in years (>25 years), duration of duty hours (>16 h/day), addiction habits, and number of monthly holidays (no holiday). We found role ambiguity, under participation, role overload, strenuous working condition, and unprofitability as predominant scales in OSI. So prevention as well as management of stress in policemen is the necessity of the current situation. This stress can be managed at organizational level by adopting right techniques, whereas at individual level by habituating right behavior and attitude.

VPost stapedotomy aviation: A changing scenario.
p3432
aVAeromedical implications of stapedotomy like rapid barometric changes and G forces are generally thought to put an end to the aviation career of an aviator. Aviation industry has grown tremendously in the last few decades, and aviation now is not only occupational but also recreational. The Indian Military Aviation rules state that, "Stapedectomy cases will be assessed permanently unfit for flying duties. These cases will be cautioned against flying in an unpressurised aircraft." The basis of this is the aeromedical concerns associated with stapedotomy as clinical conditions which are of minor significance on the ground may become aggravated in the air. With an ever expanding civil and military aviation industry, the number of aviators who have undergone stapedotomy has also increased. Though grounding the aircrew is the safest option, but if medical certification is denied to all, then the majority who can fly safely will also be excluded, thus denying the organization of its trained resources. This paper discusses post otosclerosis and post stapedotomy aeromedical concerns, reviews existing literature concerning post stapedotomy aviation and various post stapedotomy aviation policies.

VGreen biotechnology, nanotechnology and bio-fortification: perspectives on novel environment-friendly crop improvement strategies.
p3437
aVFood insecurity and malnutrition are prominent issues for this century. As the world's population continues to increase, ensuring that the earth has enough food that is nutritious too will be a difficult task. Today one billion people of the world are undernourished and more than a third are malnourished. Moreover, the looming threat of climate change is exasperating the situation even further. At the same time, the total acreage of arable land that could support agricultural use is already near its limits, and may even decrease over the next few years due to salination and desertification patterns resulting from climate change. Clearly, changing the way we think about crop production must take place on multiple levels. New varieties of crops must be developed which can produce higher crop yields with less water and fewer agricultural inputs. Besides this, the crops themselves must have improved nutritional qualities or become biofortified in order to reduce the chances of 'hidden hunger' resulting from malnourishment. It is difficult to envision the optimum way to increase crop production using a single uniform strategy. Instead, a variety of approaches must be employed and tailored for any particular agricultural setting. New high-impact technologies such as green biotechnology, biofortification, and nanotechnology offer opportunities for boosting agricultural productivity and enhancing food quality and nutritional value with eco-friendly manner. These agricultural technologies currently under development will renovate our world to one that can comfortably address the new directions, our planet will take as a result of climate change.

VMinimal incision scar-less open umbilical hernia repair in adults - technical aspects and short-term results.
p3440
aVThere is no gold standard technique for umbilical hernia (UH) repair. Conventional open UH repair often produces an undesirable scar. Laparoscopic UH repair requires multiple incisions beyond the umbilicus, specialized equipments, and expensive tissue separating mesh. We describe our technique of open UH repair utilizing a small incision. The technique was derived from our experience with single incision laparoscopy. We report the technical details and short-term results.This is a retrospective analysis of the first 20 patients, who underwent minimal incision scar-less open UH repair, from June 2011 to February 2014. A single intra-umbilical curved incision was used to gain access to the hernia sac. Primary suture repair was performed for defects up to 2\u2009cm. Larger defects were repaired using an onlay mesh. In patients with a BMI of 30\u2009kg/m(2) or greater, onlay mesh hernioplasty was performed irrespective of the defect size.A total of 20 patients, 12 males and 8 females underwent the procedure. Mean age was 50 (range 29-82) years. Mean BMI was 26.27 (range 20.0-33.1) kg/m(2). Average size of the incision was 1.96 range (1.5-2.5) cm. Mesh hernioplasty was done in nine patients. Eleven patients underwent primary suture repair alone. There were no postoperative complications associated with this technique. Average postoperative length of hospital stay was 3.9 (range 2-10) days. Mean follow-up was 29.94\u2009months (2\u2009weeks to 2.78\u2009years). On follow-up there was no externally visible scar in any of the patients. There were no recurrences on final follow-up.This technique provides a similar cosmetic effect as obtained from single port laparoscopy. It is easy to perform, safe, offers good cosmesis, does not require incisions beyond the umbilicus, and cost effective, with encouraging results on short-term follow-up. Further research is needed to assess the true potential of the technique and the long-term results.

Such variation in the root canal anatomy is uncommon in mandibular first premolars and very rare in mandibular second premolars. The C-shaped canal is so named for the cross-sectional morphology of the root and root canal. The main anatomic feature of C-shaped canals is the presence of a fin or web connecting the individual root canals. Failure of the Hertwig's epithelial root sheath to fuse on the lingual or buccal root surface is the main cause of C-shaped roots, which always contain a C-shaped canal. This case report describes an unusual occurrence of C-shaped roots in mandibular first and second premolars bilaterally, diagnosed with the aid of spiral computed tomography.

The PubMed/MEDLINE/Google Scholor databases were searched electronically using 'talon cusp', 'dens evaginatus', 'anterior teeth', mandible, 'primary dentition' and ' permanent dentition' as search terms in various combinations. The citation lists from the included references were subsequently examined, and a hand search was also performed in an attempt to identify additional reports. The distribution, characteristics, common tooth type, associated dental anomaly and proposal of new classification have been included in final data analysis. Descriptive statistics were carried out using Chi square test (SPSS, version 17).Overall 37 citations were retrieved from the literature where one was prevalence studies and rest were case reports among those two were duplication. Total 35 articles with 43 patients were reported on mandibular talon cusps. Males were predominantly affected than females (p<0.05). Eight cases (19%) were reported in archeological skulls 81% were clinical reports. Forty cases (93%) were reported in permanent dentition while 7% cases in primary dentition. Lingual mandibular talon are more common than facial type in permanent dentition facial talons (p<0.05). Seven cases (18%) were bilaterally involved. Double tooth (45%) was commonly associated with mandibular talons. Most of the cases reported from Asia and asia derived populations.Central incisor is the most common tooth type that effected by talon cusp in permanent dentition and lateral incisor is in primary dentition. Lingual talons are common in mandible. Double tooth common dental anomaly associated with mandibular talon cusp. Most of the case reported from Asia. Talon cusps should be classified as facial, lingual, and facial and lingual types. Key words:Double tooth, permanent dentition, primary dentition, mandibular arch, Talon cusp.

A pre-structured questionnaire designed by Mandall et al, with nine conceptual impact sub-scales to highlight the problem faced by the patient in daily life after wearing the appliance was used to collect the data. Unpaired t-test was used to determine the statistical significance and the influence of variables were analysed using multiple linear regression analysis.Factors which demonstrated high impact were oral hygiene (Mean=3.42; SD=0.78) followed by time constraints (Mean=3.23; SD=0.72) and physical impact (Mean=3.00; SD=0.61). Gender difference showed statistical significance in social impact (p=0.009), time constraints (p=0.001) and travel or cost implications (p=0.009). Internal reliability of the questionnaire ranged from low to good (Cronbach's alpha 0.29-0.81). Test-retest reliability ranged from an intra-class correlation coefficient 0.09-0.42.Patients who had been comprehensively informed about their treatment had greatest levels of satisfaction and compliance with treatment. Younger patients showed an earlier adaptation to treatment with fixed appliances which influenced the treatment to be started at the earliest possible age.

The statistical analysis was done using Chi-square test and p<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.The age of the patients ranged from 8-70 years with a mean age of 32.6 years. The prevalence of lip lesions was 18.8%. The most commonly diagnosed lesions were those due to infections, which affected 32.6% of the population, followed by mucocele (29.8%) and premalignant lesions and conditions which were observed in 20.6% of the population. Males were more commonly affected than females.The relatively high prevalence of the lip lesions suggests dental practitioners and health care workers to educate the patients and create more awareness regarding them. The dentists should have adequate knowledge about the etiology, clinical features, diagnosis and management of the lip lesions. Key words: Lip, lesions, India, prevalence.

A multi-speciality expertise was involved and a full term female baby was delivered.The patient presented in a Government hospital, Dehradun, India. At the time of presentation the fetal heart sounds were absent and subsequently the severe post-burn deformity involving the anterior trunk, perineum and thighs were discovered.Immediately a multi-speciality approach involving the plastic, obstetrics and pediatrics field were called for and an emergency caesarean with simultaneous contracture release with split skin grafts were performed after optimizing the patient for surgery.This is one of the first case reports reporting this rare combination of post burn contracture of trunk and perineum with fetal distress requiring emergency caesarean section along with release of abdominal and perineal post-burn contracture. This case interestingly reinforces that in such complicated cases a systematic and a combined multi-speciality approach still holds the key to patient's treatment even in district hospitals.

p3480
aVA typical muscle variation of latissimus dorsi - the axillary arch is represented by the muscular or fibromuscular slip detached from the anteroinferior border of the musculus latissimus dorsi passing over the axilla under the axillary fascia crossing the medial side of the brachial plexus to continue as a septum intermusculare mediale brachii distally to the medial epicondyle of humerus. The full extent of the muscle is rarely present. Slips of muscle extend from the latissimus dorsi at the inferior angle of scapula to insert into pectoralis major (Langer), coracobrachilis, biceps or coracoid process forming what is described as a common variant - the muscular axillary arch. We report three cases of variants of latissimus dorsi, one of which has not been reported in the literature before.

aVIn this single case study, the possible effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) was explored in the form of light emitting diodes on a chronic non-healing wound of 6 months duration in an 18-year-old male patient suffering from thalassemia intermedia. After irradiation, with LLLT dosage of 17.3 J/cm(2) for 8 min for 2 weeks duration followed by proliferative dosage of 8.65-4.33 J/cm(2) for 4 min from 3(rd) week to 6(th) week for 2 min along with antibiotics vancomycin (15 mg/kg) and a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (1 g). Proliferation of healthy granulation tissue was observed with decrease in score of pressure ulcer scale with complete re-epithelialization eventually LLLT irradiation could be a novel method of treatment for chronic non-healing wound in a thalassemia intermedia patient and an useful adjunct to standard care of treatment of pressure ulcers. It is postulated that LED irradiation augments wound healing with an early closure and no recurrence at the irradiated site even after follow up of 6 months.

VLaser: The torch of freedom for ankyloglossia.
p3492
aVThe tongue is an important oral structure that affects speech, position of teeth, periodontal tissues, nutrition, swallowing, nursing, and certain social activities. Ankyloglossia or tongue-tie, is a congenital anomaly characterized by an abnormally short lingual frenulum, which restricts mobility of the tongue. Though the ankyloglossia is not a serious condition, it may lead to a host of problems including infant feeding difficulties, speech disorders, and various mechanical and social issues related to the inability of the tongue to protrude. Hence, management of ankyloglossia should be considered at any age considering the risk-benefit evaluation. Tongue being highly vascular and mobile structure, laser-assisted lingual frenectomy is the simplest, safest and less traumatic of all the treatment modalities available, with most promising results in minimally invasive dentistry. Here, a case of ankyloglossia is reported with its management by diode laser.

VTimer switch to convert suction apparatus for negative pressure wound therapy application.
p3495
aVNegative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is an established modality in the treatment of chronic wounds, open fractures, and post-operative wound problems. This method has not been widely used due to the high cost of equipment and consumables. This study demonstrates an indigenously developed apparatus which gives comparable results at a fraction of the cost. Readily available materials are used for the air-tight dressing.Equipment consists of suction apparatus with adjustable pressure valve set to a pressure 125-150 mmHg. An electronic timer switch with a sequential working time of 5 min and a standby time of 3 min provides the required intermittent negative pressure. Readily available materials such as polyvinyl alcohol sponge, suction drains and steridrapes were used to provide an air tight wound cover.A total of 90 cases underwent 262 NPWT applications from 2009 to 2014. This series, comprised of 30 open fractures, 21 post-operative and 39 chronic wounds. The wound healing rate in our study was comparable to other published studies using NPWT.The addition of electronic timer switch will convert a suction apparatus into NPWT machine, and the results are equally effective compared to more expensive counter parts. The use of indigenous dressing materials reduces the cost significantly.

aVThe most common definitions of large volume liposuction refer to total 5 l volume aspiration during a single procedure (fat plus wetting solution). Profound haemodynamic and metabolic alterations can accompany large volume liposuction. Due to paucity of literature on the effect of different tumescent solutions on the electrolyte balance and haematological changes during large volume liposuction, we carried out this study using two different wetting solutions to study the same.Total 30 patients presenting with varying degrees of localized lipodystrophy in different body regions were enrolled for the study. Prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted by Department of Plastic and Cosmetic Surgery, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi from January 2011 to June 2012. Patients were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each by using computer generated random numbers. Tumescent formula used for Group A (normal saline [NS]) was our modification of Klein's Formula and Tumescent formula used for Group B (ringer lactate [RL]) was our modification of Hunstadt's formula. Serum electrolytes and hematocrit levels were done at preinduction, immediate postoperative period and postoperative day 1.Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 15.0. Which showed statistically significant electrolytes and hematocrit changes occur during large volume liposuction.Statistically significant electrolytes and hematocrit changes occur during large volume liposuction and patients should be kept under observation of anaesthesist for at least 24 h. Patients require strict monitoring of vital parameters and usually Intensive Care Unit is not required. There was no statistical difference in the electrolyte changes using NS or RL as tumescent solution and both solutions were found safe for large volume liposuction.

VPost-burn axillary contracture: A therapeutic challenge!
p3509
aVAxillary post-burn scar contracture is a challenging problem to the reconstructive surgeon owing to the wide range of abduction that should be achieved. The aim of this paper was to highlight the various options used in managing axillary contractures in our hospital.This is a retrospective hospital-based study of axillary contractures managed at Safdarjung Hospital (a tertiary care hospital) from 2009 to 2013. The study consisted of 44 patients from all age group and both sex included in it. Patients with a bilateral axillary contracture were excluded. Axillary contracture was released and resurfaced using split skin graft and/or with different types of flaps including the propeller flap, parascapular flap. All the reconstructed cases were followed-up for a period of 12 months. Assessment was done on the basis of functional and aesthetic outcome.Forty-four patients consisting of 25 males and 19 females presented with axillary contractures that involved 44 axillae. The mean age of the study group was 17.1 years. Injuries involved the anterior axillary fold in 8 (18.18%), posterior fold in ten (22.72%), both folds and axillary fossa in 14 (31.81%) and both folds plus part of the chest wall and arm (sparing the axillary fossa) in 12 (27.27%) axillae. Surgical treatment included split-thickness skin graft in 15 (34.1%), local skin flaps in 4 (9.1%), Z-plasties in 4 (9.1%), parascapular flaps in 3 (6.82%), while propeller flaps in 12 (27.27%) and square flap were used in 6 (13.64%) patients. The percentage of improvement in abduction had a mean of 156°. The functional and aesthetic results were satisfactory.The choice of surgical procedure for reconstruction of post-burn axillary contractures can be made according to the pattern of scar contracture and the state of the surrounding skin. The choice of a flap should have priority over the skin graft because of the superior functional and aesthetic results of flaps.

VProspective long-term study of patency and outcomes of 505 arteriovenous fistulas in patients with chronic renal failure: Authors experience and review of literature.
p3512
aVThis study describes our experience of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation as vascular access for haemodialysis.This study has been carried out in our hospital from January 2004 to December 2012. A total of 505 AVFs were created in 443 patients. Maximum follow-up was 8 years, and minimum was 6 months.In this study of 505 cases of AVFs, primary patency rates by Kaplan - Meier analysis showed 78.81% patency of fistulas at the end of 1 year and patency dropped to 14.81% at the end of 5 years. Our primary failure rate was 21.2%. Basilic vein was used in 26.35% cases, cephalic vein in 63.5%, and antecubital vein in 9.75% cases. On table, bruit was present in 459 (90.9%) and thrill in 451 (89.3%) cases. During dialysis, flow rate >250 ml/min was obtained in 150 (29.9%) cases. In complications, 2 (0.4%) patients developed distal oedema, 33 (6.5%) developed steal phenomenon.Presence of on table thrill and bruit are indicators of successful AVF. If vein diameter is <2 mm, chances of AVF failure are high. Flow rates in patients with vein diam. >2 mm were significantly higher as compared with patients with vein diam. <2 mm (P < 0.001). Flow rates are higher in non-diabetic patients as compared to diabetic patients (P < 0.001). Average blood urea and serum creatinine values are significantly lesser in patients undergoing dialysis through successful fistulas as compared to patients with failed fistulas. Correspondingly, incidence of deaths is significantly lesser in patients with successful fistulas. During proximal side-to-side fistula between antecubital/basilic vein and brachial artery, dilating of the first valve toward wrist helps to develop distal veins in the forearm by retrograde flow. This technique avoids requirement of superficialization of basilic vein in the arm.

VTransoral versus extraoral approach for mandibular angle fractures: A comparative study.
p3515
aVMandibular fractures represent approximately two-thirds of all the maxillofacial fractures (nearly 70%) out of which fractures of mandibular angle represent for 26-35%.The aim of this study is to compare the transoral and extraoral (submandibular) approaches for fixation of mandibular angle fractures.The objectives of the following study are to evaluate ease of accessibility, time taken for the procedure, ease of anatomic reduction and complications.A prospective study was carried out in 30 patients reporting to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial surgery, Narayana Dental College and Hospital, Nellore, Andhra Pradesh during the period of months from November 2011 to August 2013 who were randomly divided in two groups based on computer generated simple randomization chart. Group I patients underwent transoral reduction and fixation and Group II patients underwent extraoral reduction and fixation. The ease of accessibility was analysed by visual analogue scale by the operating surgeon, time taken from incision to closure with digital clock, difficulty level index of surgeon based on the time taken for the procedure and approach related complications.The ease of accessibility in Group I was good in 53.3% while in Group II patients approached extraorally it was good in 86.7%. Group I patients approached transorally showed a mean of 49.7 min while that of Group II patients approached extraorally showed a mean of 73.4 min. Group I had a minimum difficulty level index in 60%, moderate difficulty level in 33.3% and severe difficulty level in 6.7% while Group II had a minimum and moderate difficulty level in 46.7% and severe difficulty level in 6.7%. There was 1 (6.7%) complication reported in each group.The statistical analysis of this study concludes that fracture line starting anterior to mandibular third molar and ending at anteroinferior border of the insertion of the masseter muscle or posterior body of mandible can be approached transorally. Fracture line starting posterior or distal to the third molar or posterior to the insertion of the masseter muscle to the angle of the mandible or fracture line extending high in the ramus, extraoral approach provides a better choice for reduction and fixation of the fractured segments with restoration of anatomical and functional occlusion.

p3518
aVOrthognathic surgeries and distraction osteogenesis (DO) of the jaw bones cause a change in the pharyngeal airway space (PAS). The aim of our study was to evaluate the magnitude of changes occurring in the pharyngeal airway after mandibular set-back surgeries and DO of maxilla/mandible.The study undertaken was a retrospective cephalometric study. Subjects included in our study had undergone mandibular set-back surgery or DO of maxilla/mandible. Lateral cephalograms of the subjects taken pre-operatively (T0), immediate post-operatively (T1) and after a minimum follow-up period of 6 months (T2) were studied. The cephalograms were traced manually and the following parameters were evaluated: Surface area of the PAS, pharyngeal airway width at the level of the base of the tongue, position of the hyoid bone and the tongue. Repeated measure ANOVA test was done to assess the presence of any significant changes in the proposed parameters at T0, T1 and T2. A correlation analysis was made between the mandibular/maxillary movements and the corresponding changes in the PAS.Surgical movements of maxilla and mandible do have an effect on the pharyngeal airway.It was clearly evident that the effects of mandibular movements on the PAS and the hyoid bone is more significant than the maxillary movements.

VOptions for the nasal repair of non-syndromic unilateral Tessier no. 2 and 3 facial clefts.
p3521
aVNon-syndromic Tessier no. 2 and 3 facial clefts primarily affect the nasal complex. The anatomy of such clefts is such that the ala of the nose has a cleft. Repairing the ala presents some challenges to the surgeon, especially to correct the shape and missing tissue. Various techniques have been considered to repair these cleft defects.We present two surgical options to repair such facial clefts.A nasal dorsum rotational flap was used to treat patients with Tessier no. 2 clefts. This is a local flap that uses tissue from the dorsal surface of the nose. The advantage of this flap design is that it helps move the displaced ala of a Tessier no. 2 cleft into its normal position. A forehead-eyelid-nasal transposition flap design was used to treat patients with Tessier no. 3 clefts. This flap design includes three prongs that are rotated downward. A forehead flap is rotated into the area above the eyelid, the flap from above the eyelid is rotated to infra-orbital area and the flap from the infraorbital area that includes the free nasal ala of the cleft is rotated into place.These two flap designs show good results and can be used to augment the treatment options for repairing Tessier no. 2 and 3 facial clefts.

VSecuring aesthetic outcomes for composite grafts to alar margin and columellar defects: A long term experience.
p3524
aVComposite grafts for nasal reconstruction have been around for over a century but the opinion on its virtues and failings keeps vacillating with a huge difference on the safe size of the graft for transfer. Alar margin and columellar defects are more distinct than dorsal nasal defects in greater difficulty in ensuring a good aesthetic outcome. We report our series of 19 consecutive patients in whom a composite graft was used to reconstruct a defect of alar margin (8 patients), alar base (7 patients) or columella (4 patients).Patient ages ranged from 3-35 years with 5 males and 14 females. The grafts to alar margin and base ranged 0.6-1 cm in width, while grafts to columella were 0.7-1.2 cm. The maximum dimension of the graft in this series was 0.9 mm x 10 mm. Composite grafts were sculpted to be two layered (skin + cartilage), three layered wedges (skin + cartilage + skin) or their combination (two layered in a portion and three layered in another portion). All grafts were cooled in postoperative period for three days by applying an indigenous ice pack of surgical glove. The follow up ranged from 3-9 months with an average of 4.5 months.All of our 19 composite grafts survived completely but they all shrank by a small percentage of their bulk. Eleven patients rated the outcome between 90-95% improvement. We noticed that composite grafts tended to show varied pigmentation in our patients, akin to split skin grafts.In our opinion, most critical to graft survival is its size and the ratio of the marginal raw area to the graft bulk. We recommend that graft width should not exceed 1 cm to ensure complete survival even though larger sized grafts have been reported to survive. We recommend cooling of the graft and justify it on the analogy of 'warm ischemia time' for a replantation, especially in warmer climes like ours in India. We have outlined several considerations in the technique, with an analysis of differing opinions that should facilitate a surgeon in making an informed choice.

VCurrent status of presurgical infant orthopaedic treatment for cleft lip and palate patients: A critical review.
p3527
aVRehabilitation of cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients is a challenge for all the concerned members of the cleft team, and various treatment modalities have been attempted to obtain aesthetic results. Presurgical infant orthopaedics (PSIO) was introduced to reshape alveolar and nasal segments prior to surgical repair of cleft lip. However, literature reports lot of controversy regarding the use of PSIO in patients with CLP. Evaluation of long-term results of PSIO can provide scientific evidence on the efficacy and usefulness of PSIO in CLP patients. The aim was to assess the scientific evidence on the efficiency of PSIO appliances in patients with CLP and to critically analyse the current status of PSIO. A PubMed search was performed using the terms PSIO, presurgical nasoalveolar moulding and its long-term results and related articles were selected for the review. The documented studies report no beneficial effect of PSIO on maxillary arch dimensions, facial aesthetics and in the subsequent development of dentition and occlusion in CLP patients. Nasal moulding seems to be more beneficial and effective in unilateral cleft lip and palate patients with better long-term results.

VHypertelorism.
p3530
aVThe term orbital hypertelorism (ORH) implies "widely apart orbits." This may also be associated with the abnormal vertical orientation of the orbits (dystopia). This deformity may be unilateral or bilateral, symmetric or asymmetric and may be present in a variety of craniofacial conditions. The treatment is primarily carried out for aesthetic reasons. The timing of treatment is dictated by the underlying condition and the type of procedure envisaged. The mainstay of treatment consists of moving the orbits medially to near normal position. This is accomplished by either an orbital translocation or facial bipartition technique. The choice of procedure is governed by the shape of the maxillary arch and associated occlusal conditions. We must differentiate between the telecanthus (also called pseudo-hypertelorism) and a true ORH as the management differs in these two conditions. The ORH involves extensive intracranial and extracranial operation whereas the telecanthus correction is relatively simpler surgery. The article will discuss the aetiology, classification, presentation, treatment options, timing of surgery and the choice of surgical procedures. Illustrative case reports with long-term results will be used to explain the management of these patients.

p3535
aVThe aim of this study was to prepare protein hydrolysates from underutilized common carp (Cyprinus carpio) egg and to investigate their immunomodulatory effects in vivo.Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) egg (roe) was hydrolysed by pepsin, trypsin, and Alcalase. Chemical composition (proximate, amino acid, mineral and fatty acid compositions) and molecular mass distribution of the three hydrolysates were determined. The carp egg protein hydrolysates (CEPHs) were evaluated for their immunomodulatory effects in BALB/c mice. CEPHs (0.25, 0.5 and 1 g/kg body weight) were orally administered daily to female BALB/c mice (4-6 wk, 18-20 g) for a period of 45 d. After 45 d, mice were sacrificed and different tissues were collected for the immunologic investigations.The three hydrolysates contained high protein content (64%-73%) with all essential amino acids, and good proportion of \u03c9-3 fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic acid. Molecular mass analysis of hydrolysates confirmed the conversion of large-molecular-weight roe proteins into peptides of different sizes (5-90 kDa). The three hydrolysates significantly enhanced the proliferation of spleen lymphocytes. Pepsin hydrolysate (0.5 g/kg body weight) significantly increased the splenic natural killer cell cytotoxicity, mucosal immunity (secretory immunoglobulin A) in the gut and level of serum immunoglobulin A. Whereas Alcalase hydrolysate induced significant increases in the percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in spleen.The results demonstrate that CEPHs are able to improve the immune system and further reveal that different CEPHs may exert differential influences on the immune function. These results indicate that CEPHs could be useful for several applications in the health food, pharmaceutical, and nutraceutical industries.

aVNutritional factors such as magnesium, folic acid, vitamins B12 and B6, L-arginine, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) appear to be significantly beneficial for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), and in the prevention and arresting the progression of HF and cardiac arrhythmias. Additionally, ingestion of adequate amounts of protein and maintaining normal concentrations of plasma albumin seem to be essential for these patients. These nutrients closely interact with the metabolism of L-arginine-nitric oxide (NO) system, essential fatty acids, and eicosanoids such that beneficial products such as NO, prostaglandin E1, prostacyclin, prostaglandin I3, lipoxins, resolvins, and protectins are generated and synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines is suppressed that results in platelet anti-aggregation, vasodilation, angiogenesis, and prevention of CAD, cardiac arrhythmias, and stabilization of HF. This implies that individuals at high risk for CAD, cardiac arrhythmias, and HF and those who have these diseases need to be screened for plasma levels of magnesium, folic acid, vitamins B12 and B6, L-arginine, NO, various PUFAs, lipoxin A4, resolvins, protectins, asymmetrical dimethylarginine (an endogenous inhibitor of NO), albumin, and various eicosanoids and cytokines and correct their abnormalities to restore normal physiology.

p3545
aVBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)is the most common condition in aging men, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms. It is caused due to the augmented levels of the androgen dihydrotestosterone. Dutasteride, a 5\u03b1-Reductase inhibitor has been recommended for the treatment of BPH upon oral administration. However, long term oral administration of dutasteride may cause sexual problem in man. Therefore the main objective of this study was to develop transdermal patch having nanoemulsion gel of dutasteride in order to enhance physical and chemical stability and eliminate adverse effect of dutasteride. Optimized nanoemulsion was prepared by aqueous phase-titration method and characterized by droplet size, viscosity and refractive index. In-vitro skin permeation of dutasteride through rat abdominal skin was determined by the Franz diffusion cell.Significant increase in the steady state flux (J ss), permeability coefficient (K p) and enhancement ratio (E r) was observed in optimized nanoemulsion formulation A1 (p < 0.05). The Er of optimized nanoemulsion A1 was found to be 1.52 times with respect to control which indicates transdermal delivery may be better approach for BPH. Stability studies were performed for the period of 3 months. It was found that droplet size, viscosity and refractive index were slightly increased at refrigerator and room temperature in 3 months period. However, the changes in these parameters were not statistically significant (p \u2265 0.05). The shelf-life of optimized nanoemulsion A1 was found to be 2.18 years at room temperature. These results indicated that both physical as well as chemical stability of dutasteride in nanoemulsion formulation.

aVCholera, a disease caused by Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139 remains an important public health problem globally. In the last decade, Kenya has experienced a steady increase of cholera cases. In 2009 alone, 11,769 cases were reported to the Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation. This study sought to describe the phenotypic characteristics of the isolated V. cholerae isolates.This was a laboratory based cross-sectional study that involved isolates from different cholera outbreaks. Seventy six Vibrio cholerae O1 strains from different geographical areas were used to represent 2007 to 2010 cholera epidemics in Kenya, and were characterized by serotyping, biotyping, polymerase chain r(PCR), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and ribotyping along with antimicrobial susceptibility testing.Seventy six Vibrio cholerae O1 strains from different geographical areas were used to represent 2007 to 2010 cholera epidemics in Kenya. Serotype Inaba was dominant (88.2%) compared to Ogawa. The isolates showed varying levels of antibiotic resistance ranging from 100% susceptible to tetracycline, doxycycline, ofloxacin, azithromycin, norfloxacin and ceftriaxone to 100% resistant to furazolidone, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, polymyxin-B and streptomycin. The isolates were positive for ctxA, tcpA (El Tor), rtxC genes and were biotype El Tor variant harboring classical ctxB gene. All the isolates were classified as cholera toxin (CT) genotype 1 as they had mutation in the ctxB at positions 39 and 68. All the isolates had genetically similar NotI PFGE and BglI ribotype patterns. The absence of any observed variation is consistent with a clonal origin for all of the isolates.Kenya experienced cholera numerous outbreak from 2007-2010. The clinical Vibrio cholerae O1 isolates from the recent cholera epidemic were serotypes Inaba and Ogawa, Inaba being the predominant serotype. The Vibrio cholerae O1 strains were biotype El Tor variants that produce cholera toxin B (ctx B) of the classical type and were positive for ctxA, tcpA El Tor and rtxC genes.

VTargeting the cyclin-binding groove site to inhibit the catalytic activity of CDK2/cyclin A complex using p27(KIP1)-derived peptidomimetic inhibitors.
p3553
aVFunctionally activated cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)/cyclin A complex has been validated as an interesting therapeutic target to develop the efficient antineoplastic drug based on the cell cycle arrest. Cyclin A binds to CDK2 and activates the kinases as well as recruits the substrate and inhibitors using a hydrophobic cyclin-binding groove (CBG). Blocking the cyclin substrate recruitment on CBG is an alternative approach to override the specificity hurdle of the currently available ATP site targeting CDK2 inhibitors. Greater understanding of the interaction of CDK2/cyclin A complex with p27 (negative regulator) reveals that the Leu-Phe-Gly (LFG) motif region of p27 binds with the CBG site of cyclin A to arrest the malignant cell proliferation that induces apoptosis. In the present study, Replacement with Partial Ligand Alternatives through Computational Enrichment (REPLACE) drug design strategies have been applied to acquire LFG peptide-derived peptidomimetics library. The peptidomimetics function is equivalent with respect to substrate p27 protein fashion but does not act as an ATP antagonist. The combined approach of molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD), and molecular electrostatic potential and ADME/T prediction were carried out to evaluate the peptidomimetics. Resultant interaction and electrostatic potential maps suggested that smaller substituent is desirable at the position of phenyl ring to interact with Trp217, Arg250, and Gln254 residues in the active site. The best docked poses were refined by the MD simulations which resulted in conformational changes. After equilibration, the structure of the peptidomimetic and receptor complex was stable. The results revealed that the various substrate protein-derived peptidomimetics could serve as perfect leads against CDK2 protein.

VStudy of Insulin Resistance in Subclinical Hypothyroidism.
p3556
aVThyroid hormones influences glucose homeostasis. The association of insulin resistance in overt hypothyroidism is well proven, but very less information is available about insulin action on subclinical hypothyroidism.This study was done to evaluate the association between thyroid hormones and insulin resistance in subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH).Thirty subjects diagnosed as SCH and 30 age matched euthyroids were included. Serum TSH, FT3, FT4, fasting plasma glucose and insulin were estimated. Homeostasis Model Assessment was used to assess insulin resistance (HOMA- IR).Serum TSH levels were significantly increased in SCH (14.20 ± 5.23 \u03bcU/ml) when compared with euthyroids (2.24 ±1.43\u03bcU/ml; P< 0.0001). Serum FT3, FT4 levels in SCH (2.96±0.80 pg/ml & 1.15 ± 0.52 ng/dl) were within the normal range. The mean insulin levels were significantly elevated in SCH (9.07±3.41 \u03bcU/ml) when compared with euthyroids (5.28± 2.18 \u03bcU/ml; P-value < 0.0001). The mean HOMA IR was significantly elevated in SCH (2.03 ± 0.95) when compared with euthyroids (1.05±0.45, P-value < 0.0001). TSH levels positively and moderately correlated with insulin (r= 0.43 P=0.03) and HOMA IR (r =0.48; P= 0.01). FT3 levels negatively and strongly correlated with insulin (r= -0.5, P=0.004) and moderately with HOMA IR (r= -0.38, P= 0.04). FT4 levels negatively and weakly correlated with insulin and IR (r= - 0.11, P=0.54; r= - 0.07, P=0.69 respectively). To conclude, SCH is associated with insulin resistance. Hence there is an increased risk of insulin resistance associated disorders such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular events in SCH.

VGenome-wide copy number scan identifies IRF6 involvement in Van der Woude syndrome in an Indian family.
p3559
aVSummary Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is an autosomal dominant developmental malformation presenting with bilateral lower lip pits related to cleft lip, cleft palate and other malformations. We performed a whole-genome copy number variations (CNVs) scan in an Indian family with members suffering from VWS using 2·6 million combined SNP and CNV markers. We found CNVs affecting IRF6, a known candidate gene for VWS, in all three cases, while none of the non-VWS members showed any CNVs in the IRF6 region. The duplications and deletions of the chromosomal critical region in 1q32-q41 confirm the involvement of CNVs in IRF6 in South Indian VWS patients. Molecular network analysis of these and other cleft lip/palate related module genes suggests that they are associated with cytokine-mediated signalling pathways and response to interferon-gamma mediated signalling pathways. This is a maiden study indicating the involvement of CNVs in IRF6 in causing VWS in the Indian population.

VAnalysis of gingival biopsies in the Gujarati population: a retrospective study.
p3571
aVBiopsy is an important diagnostic tool used in the diagnosis of lesions ranging from simple non-neoplastic, tumor-like lesions to malignancies, and is often the only way to diagnose oral lesions and diseases. The gingiva is the most common site for some kind of irritation or low-grade injury, resulting in localized overgrowths that are considered to be reactive and non-neoplastic lesions. This aim of this study is to analyze the frequency and distribution of gingival lesions in the Gujarati population.In this retrospective study, gingival biopsies submitted for a period of five years were included. Microscopic slides of all the cases were reviewed by two observers for confirmation of the diagnosis.Among the 106 cases of gingival biopsies, the most frequent category of lesions encountered was the non-neoplastic category, which accounted for 73.58% of the cases. Both benign and malignant neoplasms constituted 26.42% of the cases. Among the non-neoplastic lesions, Pyogenic granuloma was the most frequent lesion (38.46%), followed by fibrous hyperplasia (20.51%), inflammatory hyperplasia (19.23%), and Epulis (8.97%). Neoplasms accounted for 26.42% of the gingival biopsies (92.85% benign and 7.15% malignant). Among the benign neoplastic lesions, Fibroma (30.76%) and Fibrolipoma (26.92%) were the most frequent, followed by peripheral ossifying fibroma (23.08%) and peripheral giant cell granuloma (11%).It is difficult to compare studies carried out in various countries due to differences in people's attitudes toward oral health and the accessibility of various population groups to biopsy services. Nevertheless, this study has provided some information about the frequency and distribution of biopsied gingival lesions in the Gujarati population over a period of five years.

p3580
aVIn the present study the effects of mangiferin were tested against lung cancer-bearing mice in both the pre-initiation and post-initiation periods.Healthy male Swiss albino mice (6-8 weeks old) were used throughout the study. The animals were treated with mangiferin (100 mg/kg body weight dissolved in corn oil) two weeks before (pre-initiation) and the twelfth week after (post-initiation) the establishment of B (a) P (50 mg/kg body weight)-induced lung carcinoma.The body weight decreased and the lung weight and levels of xenobiotic and liver marker enzymes markedly increased in the carcinogen-administered animals; and mangiferin treatment brought the values of these parameters back to the near-normal ones. The activities of lysosomal enzymes in the animals with B (a) P-induced experimental lung carcinogenesis were also assessed. In these animals there was an increase in the activities of lysosomal enzymes such as acidphosphatase, \u03b2-glucuronidase, N-acetyl glucosaminidase, and \u03b2-galactosidase.Supplementation with mangiferin attenuated all these alterations, thus indicating its anticancer effect. Overall, the above data showed that the anticancer effect of mangiferin as a chemopreventive agent was pronounced.

aVTo explore sanazole (AK) directed targeting of the antineoplastic drug doxorubicin (DOX) complexed with silver nanoparticles (SNs) to tumor growth in a murine model.Sanazole (AK) and DOX were complexed with SNs, individually and in combination to obtain SN-AK, SN-DOX, and SN-AK-DOX. Solid tumors were developed on hind limbs of Swiss albino mice by transplanting Dalton's lymphoma ascitess (DLAs) tumor cells. Induction of cytotoxicity and apoptosis in the DLA cells by AK and DOX complexed with SN, individually and in combination, were examined under in vitro conditions by incubating the cells with them. SN, AK, DOX, SN-AK, SN-DOX, AK-DOX, and SN-AK-DOX were administered orally to the tumor bearing mice and the therapeutic efficacy of AK-directed targeting of SN-DOX complexes to achieve tumor control was monitored.Under in vitro conditions, SN, AK, DOX, SN-AK, SN-DOX, AK-DOX, and SN-AK-DOX induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in DLA cells to varying extents. The SN-AK-DOX complex showed higher level of cytotoxicity and apoptosis-induction in DLA cells. Similarly, administration of SN, AK, DOX, SN-AK, SN-DOX, AK-DOX, and SN-AK-DOX resulted in significant reduction in tumor volume and delay in tumor growth. The animals treated with SN-AK-DOX had the highest reduction in tumor volume and tumor growth. In fact, the tumor was almost absent in the animals of this group after the treatment.The SN complex of sanazole and doxorubicin together (SN-AK-DOX) has high anticancer activity under in vivo conditions and has great potential in tumor therapy.

aVExtra nodal involvements of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) are not so uncommon, but the involvement of oral cavity by NHL is very rare.The present study involved retrospective analysis of patients from year 2001 to 2011, who presented with oral mass and on evaluation were diagnosed to have primary extranodal NHL of oral cavity at a tertiary cancer care centre in South India.There were seven patients treated for primary NHL of oral cavity at our institute in last 10 years. The median age at presentation was 43.2 years (range 29-65 years). There were five males and two females. Oral tongue was the most common site (three patients) followed by alveolus (two patients). The other sites of involvement included gingivobuccal sulcus in one patient and hard palate in one patient. All patients were initially evaluated at oral oncology department for gradually increasing ulcerative mass in oral cavity. None of the patients had B symptoms. In our study, plasmablastic lymphoma was the most common type of NHL, followed by diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and peripheral T cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS). Out of seven patients, two were HIV positive, both having plasmablastic lymphoma. Four out of the seven patients received a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy and three patients received only chemotherapy. Only three patients could complete the prescribed chemotherapy and radiotherapy schedule and were alive and diseases free with a median follow-up of 21 months.Involvement of oral cavity by lymphoma is rare. Plasmablastic lymphoma was the most common oral cavity NHL in our patients. Although number of cases in present study was less, our data suggests that oral NHL has aggressive course with less favorable outcome. Further large sample studies incorporating rituximab-based chemotherapy and more aggressive chemotherapy for plasmablastic lymphoma will be helpful for better understanding of treatment outcome.

VA comparative study of set up variations and bowel volumes in supine versus prone positions of patients treated with external beam radiation for carcinoma rectum.
p3589
aVA prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the influence of patient positioning on the set up variations to determine the planning target volume (PTV) margins and to evaluate the clinical relevance volume assessment of the small bowel (SB) within the irradiated volume.During the period of months from December 2011 to April 2012, a computed tomography (CT) scan was done either in supine position or in prone position using a belly board (BB) for 20 consecutive patients. All the patients had histologically proven rectal cancer and received either post- or pre-operative pelvic irradiation. Using a three-dimensional planning system, the dose-volume histogram for SB was defined in each axial CT slice. Total dose was 46-50 Gy (2 Gy/fraction), delivered using the 4-field box technique. The set up variation of the study group was assessed from the data received from the electronic portal imaging device in the linear accelerator. The shift along X, Y, and Z directions were noted. Both systematic and random errors were calculated and using both these values the PTV margin was calculated.The systematic errors of patients treated in the supine position were 0.87 (X-mm), 0.66 (Y-mm), 1.6 (Z-mm) and in the prone position were 1.3 (X-mm), 0.59 (Y-mm), 1.17 (Z-mm). The random errors of patients treated in the supine positions were 1.81 (X-mm), 1.73 (Y-mm), 1.83 (Z-mm) and in prone position were 2.02 (X-mm), 1.21 (Y-mm), 3.05 (Z-mm). The calculated PTV margins in the supine position were 3.45 (X-mm), 2.87 (Y-mm), 5.31 (Z-mm) and in the prone position were 4.91 (X-mm), 2.32 (Y-mm), 5.08 (Z-mm). The mean volume of the peritoneal cavity was 648.65 cm 3 in the prone position and 1197.37 cm 3 in the supine position.The prone position using BB device was more effective in reducing irradiated SB volume in rectal cancer patients. There were no significant variations in the daily set up for patients treated in both supine and prone positions.

VA comparison between four immobilization systems for pelvic radiation therapy using CBCT and paired kilovoltage portals based image-guided radiotherapy.

aVWe commonly use 6- and 4-clamped thermoplastic molds (TMs) for rigid immobilization during pelvic radiotherapy (RT), sometimes a vacuum cushion (VC) is also used as leg support with TM. Our objective was to report the setup margins (SMs) associated with the different systems, to analyze whether any of these systems is superior, and to analyze whether any of them showed better reproducibility in any particular direction.Retrospective analysis was done by dividing the patients into four groups: 6-clamp with VC (6CVC), 6-clamp without VC (6CNC), 4-clamp with VC (4CVC), and 4-clamp without VC (4CNC). A repeat offline review was done for all patients and errors were tabulated. Statistical methods were then applied.Total 24 patients had 413 image-guided RT (IGRT) sessions, 312 were cone beam computed tomography scan (CBCT) scans and 101 were paired kilovoltage portals (kVp). There was no statistically significant difference between 6CVC and 6CNC. However, while comparing 4CVC and 4CNC, a statistically significant difference was seen in all directions. VC improved precision in vertical and lateral direction mainly, while the 6-clamped TM improved reproducibility in longitudinal direction.SM was low for all the four immobilization systems studied. There is no added benefit of using a VC with 6-clamped TM for pelvic RT. Use of a VC is recommended with 4-clamped TM to improve overall reproducibility. 6-clamped TM helps keep the errors low.

VClinical and cosmetic results of breast boost radiotherapy in early breast cancer: a randomized study between electron and photon.
p3595
aVBreast-conserving surgery followed by radiation therapy (RT) to the intact breast is now clearly established as the most acceptable strategy for women with early-stage invasive breast cancer. Recommended techniques for radiotherapy is whole breast irradiation (WBI) followed by boost to the tumor bed.The aim of this study is to compare the modalities of three-dimensional conformal RT (3DCRT) and electron beam therapy as boost in post-lumpectomy patients of early stage breast cancer, following WBI.The study comprised of selecting 50 patients of early-stage post-lumpectomy breast cancer. Each patient was initially treated by WBI (40 Gy in 16 fractions) and then followed by tumor bed boost (16 Gy in 8 fractions) with either electron beam therapy or with photon (3DCRT), 25 patients in each arm. Patients were evaluated regularly for acute and chronic radiation toxicities, cosmesis, and pattern of failure. Dosimetric comparison of the plans was also done.Median age of the patients was 42 years with 66% being premenopausal. Median duration of follow-up was 23 months. In arm A (electrons), two patients had grade III-IV reactions at treatment completion with one patient required RT interruption. Whereas, in arm B (3DCRT), five patients had grade III-IV reactions at treatment completion with three patients required RT interruption. At 6 months and 2 years follow-up, both the arms had almost similar skin, subcutaneous toxicity, and cosmetic score. At the end of 2 years, there were totally four failures among 50 patients, with one locoregional failure in both arms (4%). Dosimetric analysis revealed that conformality (radiation conformity index (RCI)), dose homogeneity index (DHI) and planning target volume (PTV) coverage was significantly better in 3DCRT boost plans. Organs at risk (OAR) dosimetry also revealed significant decrease in ipsilateral lung and heart doses with 3DCRT plans in which tangential or oblique fields were used; and whereas in electron beam, only single direct fields were used.Both electrons and 3DCRT can be used for boost planning to the tumor bed in post-lumpectomy patients. Though there was slightly increased acute skin toxicity with 3DCRT photon which led to interruption of therapy, overall cosmesis at 2 years is similar in both modalities. 3DCRT boost is a better option than electrons dosimetrically, considering the fact that conformality; PTV coverage and OAR dosimetry were superior with photons. Thus in centers where electron beam therapy is not available, 3DCRT photon can be used effectively for tumor bed boost.

aVEvaluation of the dosimetric advantage, if any, of RapidArc (double arc and triple arc [DA and TA]) over standard fixed field intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in gynecologic malignancies.A total of 20 cases of gynecologic malignancies were included. Static IMRT sliding window, single arc (SA), DA and TA plans were generated with eclipse planning system. The prescribed dose was 50.4 Gy/28# to the planning target volumes.IMRT provided target coverage equivalent to DA and inferior to TA (D95% [in Gy]--49.94, 49.58, 49.96, 50.17 for IMRT, SA, DA and TA respectively--all observations in the same sequence). Conformity index 90 (CI 90 (0.964, 0.927, 0.918, 0.822) and homogeneity index (0.0683, 0.119, 0.098, 0.097) of IMRT were superior. TA was superior to other arcs in all parameters except CI 90 (P=0.805) and bladder dose (lower in DA). Rectal, bladder and bowel sparing was best achieved with IMRT followed by TA; bilateral femur dose was lower in arcs. The total monitor units and treatment time of arcs were significantly lower than IMRT, reduced by a factor of 2.41-2.59 and 3.2-3.5 respectively (All P values significant).IMRT provided better overall plan for gynecologic malignancies with lower organs at risk dose and target coverage equivalent to DA and TA. Treatment delivery efficiency was higher with RapidArc. The TA plan is dosimetrically superior to DA, but the gain is small. The decision whether or not to add a third arc for a small gain should be individualized.

The prescribed dose was 4500 cGy in 25 fractions. Both VMAT and IMRT plan were generated in all cases and Dose Volume Histogram (DVH) comparative analysis was performed for PTV and OAR. Paired t-test was used for statistical analysis.The PTV Dmean and D95 in IMRT and VMAT plan were 4566.6±50.6 cGy vs 4462.8±81.8 cGy (P=0.1) and 4379.8±50.6 cGy Vs 4424.3±109.8 cGy (P=0.1), respectively. The CI and HI for PTV in IMRT vs VMAT plans were 0.96±0.02 vs 0.97±0.01 (P=0.4) and 10.58±3.07 vs 9.45±2.42 (P=0.2), respectively. Lung doses for VMAT vs IMRT were 4.19 vs 2.59% (P=0.03) for V35-7.63 vs 4.76% (P=0.01) for V30-13.6 vs 9.98% (P=0.01) for V25-24.77 vs 18.57% (P=0.04) for V20-46.5 vs 34.73% (P=0.002) for V15. The Mean Lung Dose (MLD) was reduced by VMAT technique compared to IMRT; 1524.6±308.37 cGy and 1353±186.32 cGy (P=0.012). There was no change in Dmax to spinal cord in both the techniques. There was a dose reduction by VMAT compared to IMRT to the heart but it was statistically insignificant; V35-6.75% vs 5.55% (P=0.223); V30-12.3% vs 10.91% (P=0.352); V25-21.81% vs 20.16% (P=0.459); V20-38.11% vs 32.88% (P=0.070); V15-61.05% vs 54.2% (P=0.10).VMAT can be a better option in treating mid esophageal carcinoma as compared to IMRT. The VMAT plans resulted in equivalent or superior dose distribution with a reduction in the dose to lung and heart.

aVThe perioperative use of epirubicin, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (ECF) significantly improves outcomes in patients with gastric and gastro-oesophageal (GO) cancers but is cumbersome to administer. Given the equivalence of epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and capectabine (EOX) with ECF in advanced setting, we analyzed the compliance, efficacy, and toxicity of perioperative EOX in resectable but locally advanced cancers.This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained database of patients treated between January 2012 and September 2013 at Tata Memorial Centre. Patients were planned to receive 3# of neoadjuvant (NA) and 3# of adjuvant EOX (intravenous epirubicin 50 mg/m 2 D1, oxaliplatin 130 mg/m 2 , on D1, capecitabiine 1250 mg/m 2 D1-21) every 21 days. On completion of NA therapy, patients were planned to undergo gastrectomy and D2 lymphadenectomy.A total of 99 patients (76% males, median age 51 years) were treated with perioperative EOX. Preoperatively, 93% patients completed EOX. Post-NA chemotherapy, 4 patients progressed, 1 patient died and 94 were taken up for surgery. Of these, 9 were inoperable and 85 patients underwent radical surgery. Of these, 71% (60/85) were able to complete three cycles of adjuvant EOX. The compliance to complete all 6 cycles of perioperative chemotherapy was 64%. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were comparable to the MAGIC dataset apart from higher number of diarrhea in our patients.In patients with resectable GO adenocarcinoma, it is possible to deliver the MAGIC-type perioperative chemotherapy with EOX with better compliance, toxicity, and efficacy rates.

aVThe burden of cancer is continuously increasing, and is rapidly becoming a global pandemic. The first liposomal encapsulated anticancer drug which received clinical approval against malignancies including solid tumours, transplantable leukemias and lymphomas was Doxorubicin HCl. This review is aimed at providing an overview of doxorubicin in cancer therapy. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin has a polyethylene glycol (PEG) layer around doxorubicin-containing liposome as the result of a process known as pegylation. Non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (NPLD) was developed to overcome the drawbacks associated with previous formulations. Nudoxa\u037e (NPLD) with its unique drug delivery system offers the benefit of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin without hand foot syndrome as the major side effect. Future studies will be directed towards estimating the costs of treatment with the novel liposomal doxorubicin formulations in order to assess their widespread use and robustness in treating patients with cancer.

aVThe cancer stem cell (CSC) concept derives from the fact that cancers are dysregulated tissue clones whose continued propagation is vested in a biologically distinct subset of cells that are typically rare. Rare CSCs have been isolated from a number of human tumors, including hematopoietic, brain, colon, and breast cancer. With the growing evidence that CSCs exist in a wide array of tumors, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate self-renewal and differentiation because corruption of genes involved in these pathways likely participates in tumor growth. Understanding the biology of CSCs will contribute to the identification of molecular targets important for future therapies.

VGrading systems in the cytological diagnosis of breast cancer: a review.
p3613
aVIn developing countries, diagnosis of breast carcinoma is still made on fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). For the resource-poor settings, FNAC is cheaper, less invasive and can sample different areas of the lesion compared with core needle biopsy. The role of breast FNA is usually limited to just categorize the lesion as benign or malignant. Prognostic information from cytomorphology, conveyed to the clinician depends upon the cytopathologist's way of formatting the report. PubMed-based literature search collated the information from articles describing the architectural and cytological features studied on breast aspiration smears. This review focuses on cytomorphological features and the different grading systems with their strengths, short-comings, and practical applicability. Eight worldwide articles proposing new methods of grading the cytological smears from breast cancers were published between 1980 and 2006. All the grading methods were developed for the most common type of breast cancer, that is, infiltrating duct carcinoma (not otherwise specified) type, and most of the workers used Papanicolaou-stained smears for the purpose of grading. Moreover, if interpreted carefully FNAC smears can convey information on most of the histological features. Hence, in developing countries, the focus should be on extracting the maximum information from cytological smears, so that a more precise "surgical pathology" type diagnosis can be given, instead of merely reporting as benign or malignant. Among all the discussed grading systems, we suggest grading system by Howell would be most appropriate and closest to the accepted histologic grading system as it applies Scarff-Bloom-Richardson histological grading system with modifications on FNA smears. We recommend it to be followed by all cytopathologists, in order to bring uniformity in the reporting of breast FNAs for grading the malignant lesions.

VReactive oxygen species as mediator of tumor radiosensitivity.
p3616
aVIn normal functioning of the cell, there is a balance between generation and neutralization of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by endogenous cellular defense machinery. Low levels of ROS inside the cells are required for normal functioning of the cell, which regulate signaling mechanisms involved in mitosis and apoptosis; excess of ROS production may cause oxidative stress leading to damage in vital cellular molecules, namely cytosolic lipids, proteins, and DNA. In the situation of intracellular redox imbalance, molecules of cells are altered by ROS leading to pathogenic state. It is to be noted that ROS is not only known to be involved in tumor induction and progression processes but also enhances tumor cell radiosensitivity. The level of ROS-mediated oxidative stress is linked to cellular radiosensitivity. In general, cancer cells exhibit high levels of ROS, which forms a target for selectively killing them by radiation. In this paper, we have reviewed how oxidative stress determines the radiosensitivity of tumor cells involving ROS in the mechanism of radiation induced tumor cell killing. It is suggested that radiation-induced ROS play a key role in the mechanism of tumor cell killing by altering the signaling network and triggering of apoptosis. Furthermore, it is pointed out that combined use of plant-derived antioxidants and radiation enhance overproduction of ROS in tumor cells leading to enhanced radiosensitivity, which may find practical applications in clinic.

VAn atypical metastasis of renal clear cell carcinoma to the upper lip: a case report.
p3621
aVMetastatic lesions of the oral cavity are extremely rare, accounting for approximately 1% of all malignant oral tumors. Renal clear cell carcinoma (RCCC) constitutes about 3% of the solid tumors in adults. It is the third most frequent neoplasm to metastasize to the head and neck region, preceded by breast and lung carcinoma. Because of the silent growth of this neoplasm, most patients are asymptomatic and are diagnosed in an advanced stage, frequently with metastases. We report an unusual case of a 60-year-old male patient with an ulcerated nodule on the upper lip mimicking a keratoacanthoma. He was treated for left-sided RCCC 5 months earlier. The lesion was excised, and the histopathologic findings were suggestive of metastatic RCCC. The clinical features, prognosis, and treatment modalities for metastatic lesions are reviewed in our report. This case is a rarity because only 3 cases of metastatic RCCC of the upper lip have been reported in the literature.

VChallenges in the reconstruction of bilateral maxillectomy defects.
p3624
aVBilateral maxillectomy defects, if not adequately reconstructed, can result in grave esthetic and functional problems. The purpose of this study was to investigate the outcome of reconstruction of such defects.This is a retrospective case series. The defects were analyzed for their components and the flaps used for reconstruction. Outcomes for flap loss and functional indices, including oral diet, speech, and dental rehabilitation, also were evaluated.Ten consecutive patients who underwent bilateral maxillectomy reconstruction received 14 flaps. Six patients had malignancies of the maxilla, and 4 patients had nonmalignant indications. Ten bony free flaps were used. Four soft tissue flaps were used. The fibula free flap was the most common flap used. Three patients had total flap loss. Seven patients were alive and available for functional evaluation. Of these, 4 were taking an oral diet with altered consistency and 2 were on a regular diet. Speech was intelligible in all patients. Only 2 patients opted for dental rehabilitation with removable dentures.Reconstruction after bilateral maxillectomy is essential to prevent esthetic and functional problems. Bony reconstruction is ideal. The fibula bone free flap is commonly used. The complexity of the defect makes reconstruction difficult and the initial success rate of free flaps is low. Secondary reconstructions after the initial flap failures were successful. A satisfactory functional outcome can be achieved.

aVThe mucoralean fungi are emerging causative agents of primary cutaneous infections presenting in the form of necrotizing fasciitis.The aim of this study was to investigate a series of suspected necrotizing fasciitis cases by Apophysomyces species over one-year period in a northern Indian hospital.The clinical details of those patients suspected to suffer from fungal necrotizing fasciitis were recorded. Skin biopsies from local wounds were microscopically examined and fungal culturing was carried out on standard media. The histopathology was evaluated using conventional methods and special stains. Apophysomyces isolates were identified by their morphology and by molecular sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal genes. Antifungal susceptibility testing was carried out following EUCAST guidelines and treatment progress was monitored.Seven patients were found to be suffering from necrotizing fasciitis caused by Apophysomyces spp. Six isolates were identified as Apophysomyces variabilis and one as Apophysomyces elegans. Five patients had previously received intramuscular injections in the affected area. Three patients recovered, two died and the other two left treatment against medical advice and are presumed to have died due to their terminal illnesses. Posaconazole and terbinafine were found to be the most active compounds against A. variabilis, while the isolate of A. elegans was resistant to all antifungals tested.Apophysomyces is confirmed as an aggressive fungus able to cause fatal infections. All clinicians, microbiologists and pathologists need to be aware of these emerging mycoses as well as of the risks involved in medical practices, which may provoke serious fungal infections such as those produced by Apophysomyces.

aVLycopodium clavatum (Lyc) is a widely used homeopathic medicine for the liver, urinary and digestive disorders. Recently, acetyl cholinesterase (AchE) inhibitory activity has been found in Lyc alkaloid extract, which could be beneficial in dementia disorder. However, the effect of Lyc has not yet been explored in animal model of memory impairment and on cerebral blood flow.The present study was planned to explore the effect of Lyc on learning and memory function and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in intracerebroventricularly (ICV) administered streptozotocin (STZ) induced memory impairment in rats.Memory deficit was induced by ICV administration of STZ (3 mg/kg) in rats on 1st and 3rd day. Male SD rats were treated with Lyc Mother Tincture (MT) 30, 200 and 1000 for 17 days. Learning and memory was evaluated by Morris water maze test on 14th, 15th and 16th day. CBF was measured by Laser Doppler flow meter on 17th day.STZ (ICV) treated rats showed impairment in learning and memory along with reduced CBF. Lyc MT and 200 showed improvement in learning and memory. There was increased CBF in STZ (ICV) treated rats at all the potencies of Lyc studied.The above study suggests that Lyc may be used as a drug of choice in condition of memory impairment due to its beneficial effect on CBF.

VIncrease in the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase on exposure to bisphenol A: a possible cause for decline in steroidogenesis in male mice.
p3636
aVBisphenol A (BPA) is a well-known plasticizer and xenoestrogen that is responsible for many acquired reproductive difficulties, especially in men. Despite the prevalence of BPA in society, the mechanism behind reproductive deficits remains elusive. The present study investigates the mode of BPA's action by evaluating its effect on the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and steriodogenic acute regulatoryprotein (StAR) in male mice testis. Swiss albino mice were treated with a range BPA concentrations of 0.5, 50 and 100\u03bcg/kg body weight/day intraperitoneally for 60 days. Several markers of oxidative stress and male fertility were investigated. Nitrite levels, malondialdehyde levels and testicular injury scores were elevated whereas the sperm count, serum testosterone levels and catalase activity were reduced in the BPA groups. Mechanistically, an increase in iNOS expression was observed in the testis whereas the expression of the StAR was down regulated in the BPA treated mouse. These results suggest that BPA induces oxidative stress by altering the expression of iNOS, which consequently leads to the down regulation of StAR expression in the testis of male mouse.

aVFormalin is a hazardous chemical that needs cautious handling and special storage. Owing to its disinfectant and fixative (i.e. for preserving pathologic tissue specimens in histopathology) properties, it is widely used in dentistry. Although, the terms formaldehyde and formalin are often confused as being identical, these are different as to the concentrations of the primary component i.e. formaldehyde. In fact, the common fixative available as 10% neutral buffered formalin is actually a 4% solution of formaldehyde (i.e., a 10% solution made from a 37-40% commercially pure formaldehyde solution). This case report describes an unfortunate case of accidental injection instead of local anesthetic, of formalin into the pterygomandibular space in a 35-year old woman during inferior alveolar nerve block for surgical removal of impacted lower right third molar and its successful management by cautious debridement (under both local and general anesthesia) and empirical drug therapy (utilizing analgesics and antibiotics).

p3654
aVTennis elbow (TE) is one of the commonest myotendinosis. Different treatment options are available and autologous blood injection has emerged as the one of the acceptable modalities of treatment. Long term studies over a larger group of patients are however lacking. The purpose of this study was to evaluate these patients on longer durations. One-hundred and twenty patients of TE, who failed to respond to conventional treatment including local steroid injections were taken up for this prospective study over the period from year 2005 to 2011 and were followed up for the minimum of 3 years (range 3-9 years). Two mL of autologous blood was taken from the ipsilateral limb and injected into the lateral epicondyle. The effectiveness of the procedure was assessed by Pain Rating Sscale and Nirschl Staging, which was monitored before the procedure, at first week, monthly for first three months, at 6 months and then 3 monthly for first year, six monthly for next 2 years and then yearly. Statistical analysis was done and a P value of <0.05 was taken as significant. The patients (76 females and 44 males) were evaluated after procedure. The mean age group was 40.67±8.21. The mean follow up was 5.7±1.72 (range 3 to 9 years). The mean pain score and Nirschl stage before the procedure was 3.3±0.9 and 6.2±0.82 respectively. At final follow up the pain score and Nirschl were 1.1±0.9 and 1.5±0.91 respectively. Autologous blood injection was found to be one of the modalities for treatment of TE. Being cheap, available and easy method of treatment, it should be considered as a treatment modality before opting for the surgery. Universal guidelines for the management of tennis elbow should be made as there is lot of controversy regarding the treatment.

aVCerebral metabolism will be affected in T2DM either by chronic hyperglycemia or by chronic hypoxia. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) of the brain provides detailed information about the structure, dynamics, reaction state and chemical environment of molecules. It also measures the levels of brain metabolites such as myo-inositol (mI), N acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho), glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln) and gamma amino butyric acid (GABA). Several studies suggest that people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at an increased risk of cognitive impairment in comparison with the general population. The altered metabolites may cause cognitive dysfunction in T2DM. This review article concludes that in T2DM, metabolite levels were altered in different regions of brain.

aVCephalometrically the position of maxilla is usually assessed by point A, which is one of the most common cephalometric landmarks used for spatial analysis of maxilla, however in certain scenarios we require a alternative landmark.In this study a nearest alternative maxillary apical base landmark was identified for Point A substitutions given by different authors.A cross sectional study was conducted on thirty (30) good quality lateral cephalograms. Only those lateral cephalograms were selected where Point A was easily identified. Landmarks: Sella (S), Nasion (N), Point A and three substitution points Y, L, X were traced. Angles formed by SN with Point A (Angle SNA) and three substitution points (Angle SNY, SNX, SNL) were measured. Correlation of angle SNA with angles SNY, SNX and SNL were derived. Statistical analysis used.Mean and standard deviation for Angles SNA, SNY, SNL and SNX were calculated individually for males and females. 'T' Test was applied to determine statistical significance for all the parameters i.e Age, Angles SNA, SNY, SNL and SNX respectively. Karl Pearson correlation coefficient was carried out to determine the statistical significant correlation for Angle SNA with SNY, SNL and SNX.A mean value of 82.8° ±1.9°, 83.1° ±1.8°, 78.3° ±2.9° and 78.7° ±2.7° for Angle's SNA, SNY, SNL and SNX respectively was observed. A statistically significant correlation was observed between angles SNA & SNY, SNL, SNX & strong positive correlation was observed with angle SNY.We conclude that Point Y is the most nearing maxillary apical base landmark to Point A. Hence maxillary apical base landmark can be substituted by Point Y where identification of point A is not obvious.

aVEndotracheal intubation is one of the most invasive stimuli in anesthesia and it's often accompanied by a hemodynamic pressor response. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a single pre-induction 2 µg/kg bolus injection of fentanyl followed by two puffs of nitroglycerin sub lingual spray (400 µg /spray) with a thiopentone/suxamethonium sequence in the attenuation of the hemodynamic response to endotracheal intubation in normotensive patients.The study consisted of 80 randomly selected ASA physical status I/II male/female adults who were aged between 18 through 60 years and scheduled for elective surgery. Group I received a single 2 µg/kg IV bolus of fentanyl diluted to 5 ml with normal saline 5 min prior to laryngoscopy followed by two puffs of nitroglycerin sub lingual spray (400 µg/spray) 2 minutes prior to intubation (n=40). Group II received a single 2 µg/kg IV bolus of fentanyl diluted to 5 ml with normal saline 5 min prior to laryngoscopy (n=40). Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure and rate pressure product were compared to basal values at pre-induction, induction, intubation and post-intubation as well as at time increments of 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 min.Fentanyl combined with nitroglycerin did not attenuate hemodynamic pressor responses more than fentanyl alone. Increases of HR (7.9%), DBP (4.0%), MAP (3.6%) and RPP (6.0%) along with attenuation of SBP (2.7%) were observed in the fentanyl-nitroglycerin group as compared to the equivalent control measured values.A single pre-induction bolus injection of fentanyl followed by two puffs of nitroglycerin sub lingual spray in a thiopentone/suxamethonium anesthetic sequence neither successfully attenuates nor successfully suppresses the hemodynamic pressor response more effectively than fentanyl alone in normotensive patients resulting from endotracheal intubation.

aVCavum septum pellucidum (CSP) and cavum vergae (CV) have separately and together been associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders and psychosis; however, there is little literature on the psychopathological significance of isolated CV, and no previous report of isolated CV in late-onset psychosis. We describe an 80-year-old woman who presented with a 1-month history of psychotic symptoms qualifying for a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder. Physical (including neurological) examination, bedside cognitive testing, and laboratory investigations were all within normal limits. A magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain revealed an insignificant CSP with prominent CV. The patient showed almost complete recovery from psychosis after 4-6 weeks of treatment with quetiapine (200 mg/day). She maintained improvement with this medication at an 18-month follow-up; medication taper was associated with re-emergence of hallucinations. We briefly discuss CSP and CV in the context of vulnerability to psychosis. We examine whether isolated CV is a benign and incidental finding versus a biological risk factor for neuropsychiatric illness. We suggest specific studies to resolve the uncertainty.

aVNeuropsychiatric manifestations are common in Wilson's disease and mainly include extrapyramidal and cerebellar symptoms. Presentations with psychotic symptoms have been described less frequently. In this report we present the case of a young boy with Wilson's disease who developed psychotic symptoms. A 12-year-old boy was diagnosed with Wilson's disease on the basis of the physical examination findings and low ceruloplasmin levels (8.1 mg/dl). After 2 weeks of being diagnosed with Wilson's disease, he developed an acute onset illness, characterized by delusion of persecution, fearfulness, hypervigilence and decreased sleep. These symptoms were not associated with any confusion, clouding of consciousness, hallucinations and affective symptoms. There was no past or family history of psychosis. One week after the onset of the symptoms he was prescribed tab penicillamine, initially 250 mg/day, which was increased to 500 mg/day after 3 days. After increase in the dose of penicillamine, his psychiatric symptoms worsened and led to hospitalization. A diagnosis of organic delusional disorder (F06.2) due to Wilson's disease was considered. Tab risperidone 1 mg/day was started, and the dose of penicillamine was reduced with which symptoms resolved. Whenever a young adolescent develops psychosis, especially of delusional type, the possibility of Wilson's disease must be considered.

Later Indian culture is influenced by Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity. Indian belief system carries the footprints of these cultures. Every culture describes human behaviors and an interpretation of each human behavior is largely influenced by the core cultural belief system. Sexuality is an important domain which is colored by different cultural colors. Like other cultures, Indian culture believes "semen" as the precious body fluid which needs to be preserved. Most Indian beliefs consider loss of semen as a threat to the individual. Ancient Indian literature present semen loss as a negative health related event. Dhat syndrome (related to semen loss) is a culture-bound syndrome seen in the natives of Indian subcontinent. This article gathers the Indian concepts related to semen loss.

Block has 80 villages, of which 11 villages were randomly selected. Eleven camps were organized for elderly people in 11 randomly selected villages on predetermined dates. A total of 728 elderly persons of age >60 years were examined, interviewed and data thus collected was analyzed. Elderly who got Hindi-mini-mental state examination (HMSE) score developed by Ganguli based on the Indo-US Cross-National Dementia Epidemiology Study) score \u226423 were evaluated further and in those with confirmed cognitive and functional impairment, diagnosis of dementia was assigned according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorder fourth edition criteria after ruling out any psychiatric illness or delirium. Based on International Classification of Diseases-10 diagnostic criteria sub-categorization of dementia was done.Mean, median and 10(th) percentile of HMSE of the study population were 23.4, 24 and 17, respectively. About 14.6% elderly had scored <17. 42.9% of rural elderly population had HMSE score <23, 70.6% <27 and 27.7% between 23 and 27. Literate people had statistically significant higher mean HMSE score (26.1 ± 3.9) than illiterate people (22.9 ± 4.9). Other risk factors were female gender, malnutrition, and obesity. Prevalence of dementia was 2.74%; in male 2.70% and in female 2.80%. Most common type of dementia was Alzheimer (male 1.5%, female 1.5%) followed by vascular (male 1.2%, female 0.6%) and others 0.6% (male 0%, female 0.6%).Study showed that a very high percentage of rural elderly attending health camps had poor cognitive function score; though the prevalence of dementia was relatively low. Alzheimer dementia was most common, followed by vascular dementia, which was predominant in males. Illiteracy, age, and under-nutrition were the most important risk factors for poor cognitive function. Our study suggest that cut-off of HMSE score should be 17 (10(th) percentile) for illiterate population.

For increasing the acceptability of the ICD-11, WHO along with World Psychiatric Association (WPA), conducted a survey of psychiatrists around the world, in which 386 psychiatrists from India participated.To present the findings of "WPA-WHO Global Survey of Psychiatrists' Attitudes toward Mental Disorders Classification" for Indian psychiatrists who participated in the survey as members of Indian Psychiatric Society.The online survey was sent to qualified psychiatrists who are members of Indian Psychiatric Society and are residing in India.Of the 1702 members who were urged to participate in the survey, 386 (22.7%) participated. Most(79%) of the psychiatrists opined that they use formal classificatory systems in their day-to-day clinical practice. ICD-10 was the most commonly (71%) followed classificatory system. Nearly half (48%) felt the need for only 10-30 categories for use in clinical settings and another 44% opined that 31-100 categories are required for use. Most of the participants (85%) suggested that a modified/simpler classificatory system should be designed for primary care practitioners. Similarly, the same number of participants (89%) argued that for maximum utility of a nosological system diagnostic criteria should provide flexible guidance that allows cultural variation and clinical judgement. About 75% opined that the diagnostic system they were using was difficult to apply across cultures.Findings of the survey suggest that classificatory systems are routinely used in day-to-day practice by most of the participating psychiatrists in India and most expect that future classificatory system should provide flexible guidance that allows cultural variation and clinical judgement.

VOxidative stress and level of antioxidant enzymes in drug-naive schizophrenics.
p3715
aVSchizophrenia is a chronic illness having varied etiology which affects cognition, emotion, perception, and other aspects of behavior. There are data which show possible role of oxidative stress and disturbance in antioxidant mechanisms in various neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.Fifty drug-naive schizophrenic patients, who attended psychiatry outpatient department/inpatient department for the 1(st) time, were selected and compared with 50 age-sex matched healthy controls. The erythrocyte level of malondialdehyde (MDA) - a lipid peroxidation product and marker of oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymes - superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) was estimated. We also correlated the sociodemographic parameters and severity of illness (positive and negative syndrome scale score) with oxidative stress (MDA) and level of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GPX).The level of oxidative stress (MDA) was increased, and the levels of antioxidative enzymes (GPX and SOD) were decreased in schizophrenic patients as compared to normal healthy controls and the difference was statistically significant. No significant relationships of age, sex, educational status, marital status, and PANNS score with oxidative stress (MDA) and antioxidative enzymes (GPX and SOD) level in schizophrenic patients was found; but there was significant relationship of locality with oxidative stress (MDA) and antioxidative enzymes (GPX and SOD) level in schizophrenic patients was found. Urban population have a higher level of MDA, GPX, and SOD than the rural population.Our findings put great emphasis on the weak pro/antioxidant defense mechanisms and its role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. We can make recommendations of dietary nutritional supplementation and adjunct antioxidants therapy with antipsychotics to treat schizophrenics.

VScale for assessment of lethality of suicide attempt.
p3718
aVLethality of suicidal attempt provides useful information regarding the behavior. There is a perceived need for a clinically useful scale that can be easily adapted to various methods and circumstances of attempt.The study intended to develop and test utility of a scale for measuring lethality that can reflect overall clinical observation taking into account various indicators of lethality and which can be used across clinical scenarios involving different methods.Cross-sectional study in a hospital.The scale for assessment of lethality of suicide attempt (SALSA) has two components: The first component has four items indicating seriousness of the attempt and its likely consequences and the second component is the global impression of lethality. All the items are scored from 1 to 5, higher scores suggestive of increased lethality. SALSA was used to evaluate lethality of 82 consecutive suicide attempters; and it was compared with lethality of suicide attempt rating scale (LSARS) and risk-rescue rating scale.Chi-square, t-test, analysis of variance, Cronbach's alpha, binary logistic regression.There was significant correlation of SALSA score with that of LSARS (r: 0.89) and risk score of risk-rescue rating (r: 0.93, P < 0.001); and negative correlation with rescue score (r: -0.569; P < 0.001). Internal consistency reliability of SALSA was high (Cronbach's alpha: 0.94). Lethality scores of SALSA differentiated known groups with different lethality, e.g. deceased and survived; attempters with different levels of medical intervention: In-patient only, intensive care, ventilator support. SALSA score significantly predicted the lethal outcome (odds ratio: 3.2, confidence interval: 1.12-8.98).SALSA is a useful instrument for assessment of lethality of suicidal behaviors during clinical evaluations considering the ease of administration, its ability to differentiate clinical groups with known variations of lethality and clinical outcomes.

aVConduct disorders (CDs) are one of the most common causes for referral to child and adolescent mental health centers. CD varies in its environmental factors, symptom profile, severity, co-morbidity, and functional impairment.The aim was to analyze the determinants of symptom profile and severity among childhood and adolescent onset CD.Clinic based study with 60 consecutive children between 6 and 18 years of age satisfying International Classification of Disease-10 Development Control Rules guidelines for CD, attending behavioral pediatrics unit outpatient.The family psychopathology, symptom severity, and functional level were assessed using parent interview schedule, revised behavioral problem checklist and Children's Global Assessment Scale.The correlation and predictive power of the variables were analyzed using SPSS 16.0 version.There was significant male dominance (88.3%) with boy girl ratio 7.5:1. Most common comorbidity noticed was hyperkinetic disorders (45%). Childhood onset group was more predominant (70%). Prevalence of comorbidity was more among early onset group (66.7%) than the late-onset group (33.3%). The family psychopathology, symptom severity, and the functional impairment were significantly higher in the childhood onset group.The determinants of symptom profile and severity are early onset (childhood onset CD), nature, and quantity of family psychopathology, prevalence, and type of comorbidity and nature of symptom profile itself. The family psychopathology is positively correlated with the symptom severity and negatively correlated with the functional level of the children with CD. The symptom severity was negatively correlated with the functional level of the child with CD.

p3724
aVThe ancient Indian system of medicine "Ayurveda" is a compendium of various health related theories and practices and explained the abnormal state of mind, i.e., psychopathology in various contexts. Hallucinations were deemed abnormal. In Ayurvedic classics, hallucinations were called false perceptions (mithyajnana), illusions (maya), infatuations (moha), or confusion (bhrama). Hallucinations were not independent but a symptom of mental disorder (manasa roga). Hallucinations of different sensory organs were observed and explained. These symptoms could be observed in patients suffering from any illness of tridosha origin, organic disease or psychiatric disorder. False perceptions observed in patients were used as tools to understand the prognosis of the condition. This article may help provide preliminary insight and encourage interdisciplinary study toward understanding one of the main symptoms of schizophrenia.

aVWe report a case of transient reduction in the diameter and tortuosity of an occluded vessel after intravitreal administration of 1.25 mg (0.05 ml) bevacizumab in a patient with ischaemic branch retinal vein occlusion. A 64-year-old hypertensive female presented with chief complaints of reduced vision in her right eye for 3 months. Her vision in the right eye was evaluated as counting fingers at 2 m. Fundus examination revealed superotemporal branch retinal vein occlusion. On fluorescein angiography, in the superotemporal quadrant, there was hyperfluorescence that increased in size and intensity in the late phase, suggestive of a leaking neovascular frond. In addition, there was capillary non-perfusion in the adjacent area. The patient was administered 1.25 mg (0.05 ml) of bevacizumab intravitreally in her right eye, under all aseptic precautions. After 1 week, her right eye fundus showed regression of neovascularisation. Fluorescein angiography also demonstrated regression of neovascularisation in addition to a decrease in the diameter and tortuosity of the retinal vessel.

Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma accounts for 80-90% of all lymphomas. Although primary intraoral lesions in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are uncommon, it is important to be aware of them as intraoral manifestations are a presenting symptom in these patients. A 72-year-old Indian male presented with a complaint of asymptomatic swelling in the left side of the face since 1.5 months. A careful clinical evaluation supported by radiologic, histopathologic and immunohistochemical investigations will help in identifying the disease at an early stage, which will result in better prognosis.

It is an asymptomatic lesion that shows an infiltrative growth pattern. When the maxillary sinus is involved, it often fills the entire antrum. Odontogenic tumors are uncommon in the maxillary molar area, which often leads to diagnostic dilemma as this region of the maxilla is in the vicinity of vital structures, and radiographic overlapping of structures is always present. We present a similar case of a 17-year-old male patient who reported with a swelling in the left maxilla that infiltrated the maxillary sinus in a short duration of time.

We also wished to evaluate the level of satisfaction of the students to the current status of professional employment in the country.Students in the second year of the dental hygienist 2-year course were asked to participate in a cross-sectional survey study. An instrument was used to obtain students' perceptions about the profession by estimating the dimensions of "Motivation," "Expectation" and "Environment". Their self-esteem was evaluated using the Rosenberg self-esteem scale. Relationship of self esteem scores with perceptions towards profession was then evaluated.Scores for dimensions including "Motivation," "Expectation" and "Environment" were significantly high, as were the self-esteem scores. The level of ESE was positively correlated with their perceptions of the profession.The perception of the Indian dental hygienist students was significantly high and positively correlated to the ESE scores. We also conclude that environmental factors may be more influential than innate cultural factors for the development of self-esteem.

aVTo evaluate the substantivity of different concentrations of Chlorhexidine (CHX) to dentin disks prepared in-vitro.Sixty dentin disks were prepared from extracted human third molars and divided into three groups (each containing 20 disks). All the disks were partially demineralized, as per standard procedure. Group A specimens were then treated with 10 microliters of 0.02% Chlorhexidine, Group B specimens with 10 microliters of 0.2% Chlorhexidine, and Group C specimens were treated with 10 microliters of 2% Chlorhexidine. They were then incubated in 1 ml of Phosphatebufferedsaline PBS (pH 7.4). The substantivity was evaluated after 24 hours and one week of incubation. CHX concentration in the eluates was spectrophotometrically analyzed.A significant amount of CHX was found retained on the dentin disks in Group B as compared to Group C. Also, Group A performed significantly better than group C. However, no statistically significant difference was observed between Group A and Group B.Both 0.02% and 0.2% Chlorhexidine can be clinically recommended when being used for prolonging the durability of resin-dentin bond.

aVThe aim of this study is to compare and evaluate the clinical outcome of the envelope-type of coronally advanced flap (CAF) alone versus envelope type of coronally advanced flap plus type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM) in the treatment of multiple buccal gingival recessions, using the split mouth study.Ten patients in the age group of 20-50 years showing bilateral gingival recessions were treated. The defects in each patient were randomly assigned as Group A, which were treated with the envelope type of CAF, and those in Group B were treated with envelope type of CAF along with the Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM). The recession depth (RD), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and width of the keratinized tissue (KT) were measured at baseline, at three and six month intervals.Forty-six Miller's class I and II gingival recessions were treated. In the CAF + Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM)-treated (Group B) sites the baseline gingival recession was 2.34 ± 0.48 mm, while in the CAFtreated (Group A) sites it was 2.52 ± 0.84 mm. Both the treatments resulted in significant recession depth reduction (P < 0.001), but the reduction was significantly greater (P < 0.01) for Group B than Group A. The probing depth changes were significant (P < 0.01) for both groups, but the difference was nonsignificant. Similarly, a significant gain of CAL was seen in Group B (2.23 ± 0.75 mm, P < 0.001) as well as in group A (1.60 ± 0.86 mm, P < 0.001) showing a significant difference (P < 0.01) between the two groups. The width of keratinized tissue was also significantly (P < 0.001) increased in both groups, but the increase was significantly greater (P < 0.001) in group B (2.30 ± 1.06 mm) than in group A (1.21 ± 0.67 mm).The envelope type of CAF along with Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM) was more effective than envelope type of CAF alone, in producing root coverage in multiple gingival recession defects, associated with gain in CAL as also in the width of KT.

The subjects were divided into one control group using distilled water and five study groups representing 0.2% tea tree oil, 3% garlic extract, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate, 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride and UV toothbrush sanitizing device. Participants were provided with new toothbrushes and toothpastes for both baseline and intervention phases. The toothbrushes were collected after two weeks for microbial analysis in both phases. The data were analysed and compared using appropriate statistical analysis.On comparing pre- and post-intervention, S. mutans colony counts, a highly significant (P < 0.001) difference was observed in all the groups. Differences of 77.74 colony forming units (CFU) in tea tree oil group, 102.87 CFU in garlic group, 68.13 CFU in chlorhexidine group, 82.47 CFU in cetylpyridinium group and 42.67 CFU in UV toothbrush sanitizer group were observed. Garlic group showed the highest reduction (100%) whereas UV toothbrush sanitizer group showed the least reduction (47.4%) in S. mutans colonies.The antimicrobial agents used in this study effectively reduced the S. mutans counts and hence can be considered as toothbrush disinfectants to prevent dental caries. The 3% garlic was the most effective among the antimicrobial agents.

aVGalectins are \u03b2-galactoside binding lectins with a potential hemolytic role on erythrocyte membrane integrity and permeability. In the present study, goat heart galectin-1 (GHG-1) was purified and investigated for its hemolytic actions on erythrocyte membrane. When exposed to various saccharides, lactose and sucrose provided maximum protection against hemolysis, while glucose and galactose provided lesser protection against hemolysis. GHG-1 agglutinated erythrocytes were found to be significantly hemolyzed in comparison with unagglutinated erythrocytes. A concentration dependent rise in the hemolysis of trypsinized rabbit erythrocytes was observed in the presence of GHG-1. Similarly, a temperature dependent gradual increase in percent hemolysis was observed in GHG-1 agglutinated erythrocytes as compared to negligible hemolysis in unagglutinated cells. The hemolysis of GHG-1 treated erythrocytes showed a sharp rise with the increasing pH up to 7.5 which became constant till pH 9.5. The extent of erythrocyte hemolysis increased with the increase in the incubation period, with maximum hemolysis after 5 h of incubation. The results of this study establish the ability of galectins as a potential hemolytic agent of erythrocyte membrane, which in turn opens an interesting avenue in the field of proteomics and glycobiology.

aVCardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Myocardial infarction (MI) is a complex multi-factorial, polygenic disorder arising from an interaction between genetic makeup of individuals and various environmental factors. CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2J2 gene involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid, generates epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) that mediate dilation of coronary arteries improving post-ischemic cardiac contractile function, reduce vascular inflammation, and increase intravascular fibrinolysis. The study is aimed at analyzing the association of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2J2 gene polymorphisms and MI risk in the South Indian population.This retrospective study consisted of 287 MI patients, 279 risk control patients and 321 healthy individuals. Blood samples were collected from all the subjects and DNA was isolated using standard phenol-chloroform method. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods were used for genotyping. To test the potential independent association between polymorphisms and the risk of MI, Multiple-logistic regression analysis was performed.Our findings displayed a significant association between CYP2J2*7 (p=0.04; OR=2.0) polymorphism and MI while comparing cases with to risk controls. We did not observe any association of CYP2C8*2, CYP2C8*3, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 with MI.Our results suggest that individuals with any conventional risk factor for MI along with CYP2J2*7 variant allele may be predisposed to risk of MI in South Indian population.

VTaking aim at a dynamic target: Noscapinoids as microtubule-targeted cancer therapeutics.
p3770
aVNoscapine and its synthetic derivatives called noscapinoids have been shown to possess potential anticancer properties. These alkaloids target microtubules and inhibit cell proliferation. Noscapinoids are microtubule poisons that induce minor alterations in the innate dynamic instability of microtubules leading to mitotic arrest and cell death. Over the past decade, a number of noscapine derivatives have been synthesized that, compared to the parent compound, show superior anticancer potential, enhanced tumor specificity and tumor regression, and little or no toxicity to normal tissues. Based on their successive synthetic modifications at different points in the scaffold structure of noscapine, aided by computational design and structure-activity relationship studies, the derivatives of noscapine have been classified into different "generations" based on modifications. Several studies have reported the potential to develop noscapinoids as anticancer drugs. Increasing their tumor specificity - either through antibody conjugation or nanoparticle-based carriers - may facilitate the progression of maytansinoid-based cancer drugs to the clinic.

aVThe authors evaluate the anatomic subtleties of lumbar facets and assess the feasibility and effectiveness of use of 'Goel facet spacer' in the treatment of degenerative spinal canal stenosis.Twenty-five lumbar vertebral cadaveric dried bones were used for the purpose. A number of morphometric parameters were evaluated both before and after the introduction of Goel facet spacers within the confines of the facet joint.The spacers achieved distraction of facets that was more pronounced in the vertical perspective. Introduction of spacers on both sides resulted in an increase in the intervertebral foraminal height and a circumferential increase in the spinal canal dimensions. Additionally, there was an increase in the disc space or intervertebral body height. The lumbar facets are more vertically and anteroposteriorly oriented when compared to cervical facets that are obliquely and transversely oriented.Understanding the anatomical peculiarities of the lumbar and cervical facets can lead to an optimum utilization of the potential of Goel facet distraction arthrodesis technique in the treatment of spinal degenerative canal stenosis.

VPost-vasectomy depression: a case report and literature review.
p3789
aVVasectomy is a commonly performed and relatively safe procedure, with low reported rates of psychological morbidity, though there is some variability across studies. Depression following a vasectomy is relatively infrequent. A married man aged 30 developed a chronic depressive episode, lasting four years and resistant to an adequate trial of fluoxetine, following a vasectomy. His depression was heralded by a post-operative panic attack, and was accompanied by medically unexplained symptoms and the attribution of all his symptoms to the procedure - a belief that was shared by his family. Psychological complications of vasectomy have generally been studied under four heads: sexual dysfunction, effects on marital relationships, chronic post-operative pain, and other complications including anxiety and depression. These complications have generally been reported at higher rates in developing countries, and are linked to poor knowledge about the procedure and inadequate pre-operative counseling. The implications of the existing literature for the patient's current complaints, and the mechanisms and risk factors involved, are discussed in the light of existing research. Suggestions for the prevention and treatment of post-vasectomy depression are also outlined.

IL-33 level was estimated by ELISA while other Th1 (IL-12, IFN-gamma and IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13) cytokines were measured using a Bio-plex bead assay. DM subjects showed a mixed Th1-Th2 profile (increased IFN-g, IL-12, IL-4 and IL-13 and decreased IL-33) while DN subjects showed enhanced Th1 profile (increased IFN-g, IL-2 and IL-12) with suppression of Th2 cytokine (decreased IL-33 and IL-13). The IL-33 levels showed a serial decline with increasing severity of insulin resistance and microalbuminuria. DN was associated with enhanced Th1 response and suppression of Th2 responses which might be due to inreased levels of IL-12 and decreased levels of IL-33 cytokines respectively.

There is a large fraction of genomes of C. dubliniensis in the database which are uncharacterized for their biochemical, biophysical, and/or cellular functions, and are identified as hypothetical proteins (HPs). Function annotation of Candida genome is, therefore, essentially required to facilitate the understanding of mechanisms of pathogenesis and biochemical pathways important for selecting novel therapeutic target. Here, we carried out an extensive analysis to explain the functional properties of genome, using available protein structure and function analysis tools. We successfully modeled the structures of eight HPs for which a template with moderate sequence similarity was available in the protein data bank. All modeled structures were analyzed and we found that these proteins may act as transporter, kinase, transferase, ketosteroid, isomerase, hydrolase, oxidoreductase, and binding targets for DNA and RNA. Since these unique HPs of Candida showed no homologs in humans, these proteins are expected to be a potential target for future antifungal therapy.

VOptimization of fermentation upstream parameters and immobilization of Corynebacterium glutamicum MH 20-22 B cells to enhance the production of L-lysine.
p3798
aVL-Lysine is an essential amino acid with high commercial importance, as it has to be available in sufficient quantities in animal and human feeds to meet their nutritional requirement. As there is constant increase in L-lysine demand every year, to meet the increasing demand it is necessary to produce L-lysine in large scale. Generally, L-lysine is produced by batch fermentation. In the present investigation, different fermentation process parameters such as fermentation time, pH, temperature, glucose concentration, airflow rate and aeration rate were studied to optimize the production of L-lysine by Corynebacterium glutamicum MH 20-22 B in a 5 L laboratory-scale stirred tank bioreactor. A comparative study of L-lysine production with free cells and immobilized cells of C. glutamicum MH 20-22 B was also investigated to determine whether free cells or immobilized cells were advantageous for production of L-lysine. In this way, optimized fermentation upstream parameters which produced the maximum yield of L-lysine were developed and it was also concluded from the present study that immobilized cells of C. glutamicum MH 20-22 B were more advantageous for L-lysine production as they yield more L-lysine compared to free cells of C. glutamicum MH 20-22 B. It was observed in the present study that the optimum values of fermentation time, pH, temperature, glucose concentration, airflow rate and aeration rate were 96 h, 7.5, 30 °C, 90 g/l, 1.0 vvm and 200 rpm, respectively, by immobilized cells, whereas in case of free cells the optimum values were 72 h, 7.5, 30 °C, 80 g/l, 1.25 vvm and 300 rpm. Immobilized C. glutamicum MH 20-22 B cells exhibited greater L-lysine production of 31.58 g/l than free cells which produced 26.34 g/l of L-lysine.

aVThe discharge of cyanide-containing effluents into the environment contaminates water bodies and soil. Effective methods of treatment which can detoxify cyanide are the need of the hour. The aim of the present study is to develop a bioreactor for complete degradation of cyanide using immobilized cells of Serratia marcescens RL2b. Alginate-entrapped cells of S. marcescens RL2b were used for complete degradation of cyanide in a packed bed reactor (PBR). Cells grown in minimal salt medium (pH 6.0) were harvested after 20 h and exhibited 0.4 U mg(-1) dcw activity and 99 % cyanide degradation in 10 h. These resting cells were entrapped using 3 % alginate beads and packed in a column reactor (20 × 1.7 cm). Simulated cyanide (12 mmol l(-1))-containing wastewater was loaded and fractions were collected after different time intervals at various flow rates. Complete degradation of 12 m mmol l(-1) (780 mg l(-1)) cyanide in 10 h was observed at a flow rate of 1.5 ml h(-1). The degradation of cyanide in PBR showed direct dependence on retention time. The retention time of cyanide in the reactor was 9.27 h. The PBR can degrade 1.2 g of cyanide completely in 1 day.

aVA unique case of unilateral ovarian luteinized thecoma with sclerosing peritonitis is reported because the association between these two conditions is extremely rare. Etiology is not clearly known. A 50-year-old post-menopausal woman presented with pain abdomen and huge swelling. Pelvic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) revealed a heterogenous enhancing mass arising possibly from ovary and adherent to uterus, bowl loops, and omentum. A spindle cell neoplasm without definite features of malignancy was reported in computed tomography (CT)-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Ascitic fluid was negative for malignancy. Her serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (1.1ng/ml) and CA125 (27.6\u03bc/ml) level was within normal limits. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral supracolic omentectomy, resection of part of colon, and supracolic omentectomy was done. Histopathological diagnosis was luteinized thecoma with sclerosing peritonitis. Tumor cells were immunoreactive to smooth muscle antigen (SMA) and CD 99 and non- reactive to ER, PR, Calretinine, and Cytokeratin. Patient developed post-operative sepsis and enterocutaneous fistula, which was managed conservatively and was kept in follow-up. According to current concept, in spite of its large size, wide-spread involvement, mitotic activity, and complications due to peritoneal involvement, behavior of this rare clinical entity is benign.

aVBreast lumps constitute a significant proportion of surgical cases in women of both developed and developing countries. The aim of this study is to look the frequency distribution of various breast lesions on fine needle aspiration (FNA).The 902 patients who presented with palpable breast lump, irrespective of age and sex were included in the study. Frequency distribution of various breast lesions with respect to age and sex was studied. Cytology grading in breast carcinoma was correlated in 69 cases with histology grading.The majority (N = 871) of patients were females with maximum (N = 566) patients between second and third decade. The 773 patients had benign breast lesions and maximum (N = 341) patients were in the second decade. Fibroadenoma was the commonest benign lesion followed by fibrocystic change and mastitis. Out of 119 malignant breast lesions, 31.93% [N = 38] were between 41-50 years of age, 28.57% [N = 34] in 51-60 years and 22.68% [N = 27] in between 31-40 years of age. Out of 119 malignant breast lumps and majority were infiltrating ductal carcinoma (N = 108). Cytology grading correlated maximum with histology grade in Grade I followed by Grade II and Grade III.With experienced hands, FNA is safe, cost effective and a reliable technique for preoperative evaluation of palpable breast lumps. FNA features are more informative when combined with physical and radiology findings (Triple test). Fibroadenoma, fibrocystic change and mastitis form the major bulk of benign breast lesions. Epithelioid cells when seen in inflammatory breast FNA smears, tuberculosis must be ruled out. In India, breast carcinoma arises in younger patients as compared to western countries. Grading of breast carcinomas must be done on FNA smears for selecting neoadjuvent therapy. Clinical breast examination and mammography screening in females should be encouraged in developing countries from the third decade onwards for early detection of breast carcinoma.

aVPerimenopausal period is characterized by a continuous decline in ovarian function due to which women are vulnerable to various physical and psychological symptoms affecting their quality of life. Currently these symptoms are managed by hormone replacement therapy. However, hormonal therapy can cause complications including malignancy which has resulted in search for various alternative therapies to improve the quality of life (QOL). Yoga is one such alternative therapy shown to enhance the QOL at all stages of human life associated with the chronic illness. There are very few scientific studies regarding the effect of yoga on perimenopause and in this study we investigated the effects of yoga therapy on physical and psychological symptoms using the standardized questionnaire.To study the effect of yoga therapy on physical, psychological, vasomotor and sexual symptoms of perimenopause.It is a prospective non-randomized control study of 216 perimenopausal women with 12 weeks of intervention. The subjects were divided in two groups with either yoga therapy [n = 111] or exercise [n = 105] as the interventional tool. The symptoms control and QOL before and after intervention in both the groups were assessed by using the menopausal QOL questionnaire.The perimenopausal symptoms in all the four domains were improved by yoga therapy, thus significantly improving the overall QOL compared to the control group.This study clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of yoga therapy in managing the distressing perimenopausal symptoms. It is easy, safe, non-expensive alternative therapy helping the well-being of perimenopausal women and must be encouraged in the regular management of perimenopausal symptoms.

aVPreservation of fertility is an important issue in the management of young cancer patients. Though embryo cryostorage is a well-established procedure, it can only be availed by couples. Recent studies have indicated increasing success rates with mature and immature oocyte cryopreservation. Cryostorage induces injuries on the human oocytes which can be minimized by slow freezing and vitrification. Selection of candiidates is crucial so that the most suitable technique can be offered without any delay in initiation of cancer therapy. Factors affecting suitability are age of patient, assessment of ovarian reserve, hormonal status and type and stage of neoplastic disease. Encouraging results have been obtained with oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM) followed by vitrification for cryostorage. Data on the use of vitrified eggs in routine in vitro fertilization (IVF) show that pregnancy rates can be comparable to those achieved with fresh oocytes.

VCorrelative (99m)tc-labeled tropane derivative single photon emission computer tomography and clinical assessment in the staging of Parkinson disease.
p3847
aVParkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a selective loss of dopamine in the striatum. Problems remain in the accurate diagnosis of PD. The diagnosis of idiopathic PD is based on the interpretation of clinical signs and symptoms could be incorrect at the time of initial presentation. In vivo imaging of the dopaminergic system has the potential to improve the diagnosis of PD in its early stages. The imaging of dopamine transporter (DAT) with (99m)Tc-labeled tropane derivative (TRODAT-1) single photon emission computer tomography/computer tomography (SPECT/CT) has been proposed to be a valuable and feasible means of assessment of the integrity of dopamine neurons. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential usefulness of (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 imaging in the evaluation of patients with PD and classify into different stages of the disease. SPECT imaging with (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 was conducted in 16 consecutive PD patients (9 men; 7 women) and in 6 age matched healthy volunteers (4 men; 2 women). The images were obtained 3 h after the intra-venous injection of the tracer. Specific uptake in the striatum and its sub-regions, including the putamen and caudate nucleus was calculated and the ratios of specific striatal binding to nonspecific occipital binding were calculated. ANOVA with Dunnett C post-hoc analysis was conducted using SPSS 20. A stepwise reduction in specific striatal uptake of (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 with increasing disease severity between healthy control versus Stage I versus Stage II versus Stage III was found in PD patients (i.e., 3.77 vs. 2.56 vs. 1.57 vs. 0.63, P < 0.05). The changes were magnified by measurement of specific putaminal uptake (1.43 vs. 0.79 vs. 0.54 vs. 0.19, P < 0.05) and specific caudate uptake (1.90 vs. 1.47 vs. 0.73 vs. 0.27, P < 0.05). No remarkable adverse reactions were found in either healthy volunteers or PD patients during or after imaging. (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 is accurate and widely available for the assessment of DAT activity, which might shed light on the integrity of the presynaptic nigrostriatal function. Our preliminary study results confirm the potential of using (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 for DAT measurement, which is clinically important for the staging of PD.

aVLymph nodal (LN) metastasis is the most important prognostic factor in high-risk endometrial cancer. However, the benefit of routine lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer is controversial. This study was conducted to assess the accuracy of [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography ([(18)F] FDG-PET/CT) in detection of pelvic and para-aortic nodal metastases in high-risk endometrial cancer. 20 patients with high-risk endometrial carcinoma underwent [(18)F] FDG-PET/CT followed by total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy. The findings on histopathology were compared with [(18)F] FDG-PET/CT findings to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of [(18)F] FDG-PET/CT. The pelvic nodal findings were analyzed on a patient and nodal chain based criteria. The para-aortic nodal findings were reported separately. Histopathology documented nodal involvement in two patients (10%). For detection of pelvic nodes, on a patient based analysis, [(18)F] FDG-PET/CT had a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 61.11%, PPV of 22.22%, NPV of 100% and accuracy of 65% and on a nodal chain based analysis, [(18)F] FDG-PET/CT had a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 80%, PPV of 20%, NPV of 100%, and accuracy of 80.95%. For detection of para-aortic nodes, [(18)F] FDG-PET/CT had sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 66.67%, PPV of 20%, NPV of 100%, and accuracy of 69.23%. Although [(18)F] FDG-PET/CT has high sensitivity for detection of LN metastasis in endometrial carcinoma, it had moderate accuracy and high false positivity. However, the high NPV is important in selecting patients in whom lymphadenectomy may be omitted.

VRole of scintimammography in assessing the response of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer.
p3853
aVLocally advanced breast cancer (LABC) is a common cancer in the developing countries. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is a very important step in the treatment of such tumors and hence that the disease can be down staged and made amenable for surgery. All the tumors do not respond to the therapy equally. Hence, it becomes very important to predict the response of chemotherapy in such cases. This study evaluated the role of scintimammography in assessing the response to NACT in 23 patients with LABC. Histologically proven 23 patients of LABC were recruited in this study. Prechemotherapy tumor size was measured clinically in all patients and technitium (Tc)-99m sestamibi test was performed before NACT for each patient. Early (10 min) and delayed (2 h) image of the breast were acquired in anterior and lateral views after Tc-99m sestamibi intravenous injections and wash out rate (WOR) was computed. After 3-4 cycles of chemotherapy, surgery in the form of modified radical mastectomy was performed in 20 out of 23 patients (3 patients lost to follow-up) with pathologic evaluation of the residual tumor size. The pretherapy Tc-99m sestamibi WOR ranged from 8.3% to 68% with mean ± SD of 34.5% ±16.5%. The prechemotherapy Tc-99m sestamibi study predicted chemoresistance (WOR >45%) in 6 out of 20 patients and no chemoresistance (WOR <45%) in 14 out of 20 patients. When the WOR cut-off was set at >45%, the predictivity of the test was indicated by sensitivity of 91.7%, specificity of 62.5%, positive predictive value of 78.6%, and negative predictive value of 82.3% with a likelihood ratio of 0.1. Tc-99m sestamibi WOR is a reliable test for predicting tumor response to NACT. WOR >45% is highly predictive of chemoresistance with likelihood ratio of 0.1 than WOR <45% being predictive of chemoresponsiveness.

All our patients were subjected to (99m)Tc DTPA ACE inhibition renal scintigraphy. All the patients underwent either computed tomography (CT) angiography and magnetic resonance (MR) angiography was done in those patients in which kidney function test was deranged. Renal angiography was subsequently performed in cases with the suggestion of RAS on CT or MR angiography. The quantitative data was expressed as the arithmetic mean, standard deviation and percentages. The intergroup comparisons for parametric data were done by Student's t-test, whereas non-parametric data was compared with Mann-Whitney U-test. The intergroup comparisons were made by paired t-test and Wilcoxon sign rank test. P <0.05 was considered to be significant, and data was analyzed by Statistical package for social sciences(SPSS-20) software. Out of 47 patients, 25 patients were in the low probability group out of which none was positive for RAS on CT/MR angiography. Out of 47 patients, 12 were in the intermediate group out of which none was positive for RAS. Ten, out of 47 patients were suspected of high probability for RAS by ACE inhibition scan out of which 4 were positive for RAS by CT/MR angiography including one with bilateral RAS. (99m)Tc DTPA angiotension-coverting enzyme inhibitor renography is a safe, non-invasive, sensitive, specific, and cost-effective test for excluding renovascular hypertension in patients who have normal or nearly normal renal function in unilateral small kidney.

Hence, we have looked into the distribution of Enterococcus spp. responsible for causing wound and soft tissue infections among trauma patients, its antibiotic resistance pattern and how it affects the length of hospital stay and mortality. A laboratory cum clinical-based study was performed over a period of 3 years at a level I trauma center in New Delhi, India. Patients with Enterococcal wound and soft tissue infections were identified using the hospital data base, their incidence of soft tissue/wound infections calculated, drug resistance pattern and their possible risk factors as well as outcomes analyzed. A total of 86 non-repetitive Enterococcus spp. was isolated of which E. faecium were maximally isolated 48 (56%). High level of resistance was seen to gentamicin HLAR in all the species of Enterococcus causing infections whereas a low level resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was observed among the isolates. Longer hospital stay, repeated surgical procedure, prior antibiotic therapy and ICU stay were observed to associate with increased morbidity (P < 0.05) and hence, more chances of infections with VRE among the trauma patients. The overall rate of wound and soft tissue infections with Enterococcus sp. was 8.6 per 1,000 admissions during the study period. Enterococcal wound infection is much prevalent in trauma care facilities especially in the ICUs. Here, a microbiologist can act as a sentinel, help in empirical therapeutic decisions and also in preventing such infections.

aVDrug resistance to Pseudomonas sp. has spread to such a level irrespective of the type of patients, that its pattern of distribution and antibiotic resistance needs to be studied in detail, especially in trauma patients and hence the study. A 6 year study was carried out among trauma patients to see the trend and type of resistance prevalent in the apex hospital for trauma care in India among nonduplicate isolates where multidrug-resistance (MDR), cross-resistance and pan-drug resistance in Pseudomonas sp. were analyzed. Of the total 2,269 isolates obtained, the species, which was maximally isolated was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2,224, 98%). The highest level of resistance was seen in tetracycline (2,166, 95.5%, P < 0.001) and chloramphenicol (2,160, 95.2%, P < 0.001) and least in meropenem (1,739, 76.7%, P < 0.003). Of the total, 1,692 (74.6%) isolates were MDR in which P. aeruginosa (75%) were maximum. MDR Pseudomonas is slowing increasing since the beginning of the study period. Of 1,797 imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolated during the study period, 1,763 (98%) showed resistance to ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin, suggesting that cross-resistance may have developed for imipenem due to prior use of fluoroquinolones. Antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas sp. is fast becoming a problem in trauma patients, especially in those who requires prolong hospital stay, which calls for proper antimicrobial stewardship.

A presumptive diagnosis can be made in patients with CD4 count <100/mm(3) based on a positive serum Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibodies, no recent prophylaxis against toxoplasmosis, intramedullary ring enhancing lesion in spinal cord supported by similar lesions in brain parenchyma. Institutions of antitoxoplasma treatment in such patients result in prompt clinical response and therefore avoiding the need of unnecessary invasive diagnostic tests. Here, we report a case of toxoplasmic myelitis in immunocompromised patient presenting as myelopathy who showed significant clinical improvement after starting antitoxoplasma treatment. Hence toxoplasmic myelitis should be considered in toxoplasma seropositive immunocompromised patients presenting as myelopathy and imaging studies showing ring enhancing intramedullary lesion.

VVirulence markers of vancomycin resistant enterococci isolated from infected and colonized patients.
p3879
aVThe aim of study was to find out the potential pathogenic role of virulence factors elaborated by strains of vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) isolated from clinical samples and VRE colonizing the gastrointestinal tract of hospitalized patients.Enterococci were isolated from various clinical samples and also from fecal specimens of colonized patients at the time of admission, after 48 h and after 5 days of admission. Various virulence determinants were detected by phenotypic tests. Vancomycin susceptibility in enterococci was detected by disc diffusion and agar screen method. Minimum inhibitory concentration was determined by agar dilution method.Out of all the clinical and fecal samples processed, 12.0% isolates were either vancomycin resistant or vancomycin intermediate. Hemagglutinating activity against rabbit red blood cells was seen with 27.8% and 25.0% of clinical and fecal strains, respectively. Slime layer formation was seen with fecal VRE strains (37.5%) when compared to clinical VRE (27.8%). Among the clinical VRE strains the most prolific biofilm producers were Enterococcus. fecalis (92.9%) when compared to Enterococcus. faecium (52.9%). Biofilm formation/(presence of adhesions) was also seen in (29.2%) of the fecal VREs. In wound infection production of gelatinase, deoxyribonuclease (DNase), and caseinase (70.0% each) were the major virulence factors. The predominant virulence factors seen in the blood stream infection were adhesin, and hemolysin (44.4% each) and in catheter induced infection were DNase and adhesins (75.0% each). Adhesin (29.2%), slime layer (37.6%), DNAse (33.3%), gelatinase (25.0%), lipase (20.8%) and caseinase (16.6%) and hemolysin (8.3%) were produced the fecal isolates.An association between adhesin (as detected by biofilm formation) and urinary tract infection, adhesion and hemolysin with BSI, as also between DNase gelatinase & caseinase with wound infection was noted.

VResazurin tube method: rapid, simple, and inexpensive method for detection of drug resistance in the clinical isolates of mycobacterium tuberculosis.
p3882
aVTuberculosis (TB) remains a serious public health problem worldwide. The emergence of drug resistance and multidrug resistance (MDR) has become the main threat to TB treatment and control programs. Rapid detection is critical for the effective treatment of patients. In recent times, a new method using the colorimetric indicator resazurin has been proposed for drug susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.In this study, the resazurin reduction assay was adapted to screw cap tubes. Using the Resazurin Tube Method (RTM), a total of 100 clinical isolates were tested against Rifampicin (RIF) and Isoniazide (INH). By visual reading, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were obtained after eight days. The results obtained were compared with the gold standard proportion method.Excellent results were obtained for RTM with a sensitivity of 100% for both RIF and INH, with a specificity of 98.7 and 95.3%, respectively. Kappa is the measure of agreement between the RTM and proportion method (PM) for RIF and INH, which was found to be 0.972 and 0.935 for RIF and INH, respectively.The RTM appears to be a reliable method for the rapid and simultaneous detection of MDR-TB and drug susceptibility testing (DST) of M. tuberculosis. It is simple, inexpensive, and with no biohazard risk involved.

VKikuchi-fujimoto disease: clinical and laboratory characteristics and outcome.
p3885
aVKikuchi-Fujimoto disease is an uncommon disorder with worldwide distribution, characterized by fever and benign enlargement of the lymph nodes, primarily affecting young adults. Awareness about this disorder may help prevent misdiagnosis and inappropriate investigations and treatment. The objective of the study was to evaluate the clinical and laboratory characteristics of histopathologically confirmed cases of Kikuchi's disease from a tertiary care center in southern India.Retrospective analysis of all adult patients with histopathologically confirmed Kikuchi's disease from January 2007 to December 2011 in a 2700-bed teaching hospital in South India was done. The clinical and laboratory characteristics and outcome were analyzed.There were 22 histopathologically confirmed cases of Kikuchi's disease over the 5-year period of this study. The mean age of the subjects' was 29.7 years (SD 8.11) and majority were women (Male: female- 1:3.4). Apart from enlarged cervical lymph nodes, prolonged fever was the most common presenting complaint (77.3%). The major laboratory features included anemia (54.5%), increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (31.8%), elevated alanine aminotransferase (27.2%) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (31.8%).Even though rare, Kikuchi's disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of young individuals, especially women, presenting with lymphadenopathy and prolonged fever. Establishing the diagnosis histopathologically is essential to avoid inappropriate investigations and therapy.

VAntimicrobial susceptibility patterns of leading bacterial pathogens isolated from laboratory confirmed blood stream infections in a multi-specialty sanatorium.
p3888
aVDealing with severe blood stream infections (BSI) is one of the intractable conditions in hospitals. The empirical treatment given remains pertinent in determining patient outcome, which becomes evidence based when substantiated by knowledge of susceptibility patterns of prevalent pathogenic organisms in the set up. This study was undertaken to determine the occurrence, species prevalence, and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of laboratory confirmed BSI (LCBSI) in patients admitted to our multi-specialty sanatorium.Eight hundred and forty-six blood samples from 829 patients suspected of having BSI were cultured as per standard microbiological procedures. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done for bacterial isolates from positive blood cultures.Sixty (7.2%) cases were established as LCBSI. A total of eight pathogenic bacterial genera were identified and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was noted. Staphylococcus spp. were most prevalent (33%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (20%), Escherichia coli (13%), Acinetobacter spp. (13%), Enterococcus spp. (12%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3%), Proteus spp. (2%), and Citrobacter spp. (2%).The study shows the prevalence of common bacterial pathogens causing BSI and their susceptibility patterns. Such studies provide benefit of instantaneous choice of antibiotic therapy aiming at improved patient management and reduced drug resistance.

aVOverall cure rates for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved; however, the neuropsychological sequelae of ALL treatment have not been adequately documented in India.The present study assesses the immediate effects of ALL treatment on neuropsychological functioning, at the Regional Cancer Center in Chennai, South India.Newly diagnosed with ALL patients (n = 24) (aged 6-15 years; 13M:11F) registered between March 2008 and February 2009 were included. Patients who had received high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) and cranial radiotherapy (CRT) as part of their treatment were enrolled for the study. Neurocognitive assessments were done to assess various functions such as performance intelligence, visuo-perception, visuo-spatial, perceptual organization, processing speed, planning, working memory, and immediate verbal memory (IVM) (Malin's intelligence scale); verbal fluency (ideation fluency test) and verbal attention (vigilance test). Three assessments were done during induction (baseline), after re-induction phase (second) and during the maintenance phase (third).The patients performed significantly worse in the third assessment (mean duration from diagnosis 17.48 months) on performance intelligence quotient (PIQ), visuo-perception, visuo-spatial, processing speed, planning, IVM, verbal attention, and verbal fluency (P < 0.05), there were no significant changes observed in visuo-perceptual organization and working memory (P > 0.05). Significant difference was observed between age groups 6 and 10 (41.7%) and 11-15 years (58.3%) in perceptual organization, verbal fluency, and verbal attention (P < 0.05) and no gender difference was observed across the three assessments (P > 0.05).Combining HD MTX and CRT had an immediate effect on neuropsychological sequelae among the children with ALL, however, long-term evaluation is recommended to study the long-term effects.

p3896
aVAcute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children. 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and methotrexate are backbone drugs for maintenance phase of treatment. Purine Analogs 6-MP/6-thioguanine/azathiopurine are metabolized to its inactive form by the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). Ninety percent of the population harbor wild type on both alleles (TPMT wild/wild), 10% are heterozygous, that is, one allele is mutant (TPMT wild/mutant) and 0.3% are homozygous, that is, both allele are mutant (TPMT mutant/mutant). In heterozygous and homozygous variant, activity of enzyme is low, leading to a higher incidence of toxicity (myelosuppression).The primary objective was to access the polymorphism of the enzyme, TPMT, in Children with ALL. Secondary objective was to correlate TPMT genotype with 6-MP toxicities.Seventy-two children with newly diagnosed ALL during first maintenance phase were serially enrolled after obtaining consent. Five ml of peripheral blood was drawn and DNA extracted. TPMT 2 polymorphisms were performed using Allele specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and TPMT 3B and 3C are performed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism.Sixty-nine children of 72 (95.8%) were wild for TPMT polymorphism and 3 (4.2%) were heterozygous for TPMT. Among the heterozygous variant one each (33.3%) were heterozygous for 2A, 3A, 3C. Febrile neutropenia was the most common toxicity in both wild and heterozygous group.The frequency of TPMT polymorphisms in children with ALL is 4.2%. Heterozygous variant is this study are one each (33%) of 2A, 3A, 3C.

aVHairy cell leukemia is a rare chronic B-cell disorder that follows an indolent but progressive course. This disorder is characterized by pancytopenia, splenomegaly, bone marrow fibrosis and the presence of atypical lymphoid cells with hairy projections in peripheral blood, bone marrow and spleen. Treatment is mainly with nucleoside analog cladribine, which induces complete remission in up to 85% cases.This is a retrospective analysis of Hairy cell Leukemia cases diagnosed and treated in the Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi between 2002 and 2013. Various parameters such as clinical features, laboratory parameters including complete blood cell count, bone marrow findings, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping by flowcytometry or immunohistochemistry, treatment protocol and complications secondary to treatment and relapse were reviewed.A total of 35 cases were diagnosed during this period of 12 years of which 27 received cladribine and went in to remission. Median follow-up duration was 26 months. 5 (18%) cases had a relapse and all relapsed cases achieved second remission with cladribine; however, there was no case of second malignancy in our cohort.Cladribine has emerged as the treatment of choice for hairy cell leukemia given that the overwhelming majority of patients achieve long-lasting complete remissions. Upon relapse, these patients could be successfully salvaged with cladribine retreatment.

aVNuclear size increases in malignant tumors and reflects DNA content, ploidy and proliferation index. Present study investigated if the nuclear morphometry could differentiate histomorphologically similar paediatric malignant small round cell tumors on hematoxylin and eosin stained sections for diagnostics in a resource poor setting.All the consecutive malignant pediatric tumors received in Pathology Department from other faculties of King George's Medical University and also those referred directly to Pathology Department from other hospitals of city/other cities during 3 years period were recorded.Morphometric analysis was done in 22 confirmed (by higher ancillary techniques) but histomorphologically difficult to differentiate round cell tumors. All sections were analyzed by cell images from six different areas, using Leica Q win 500 images software.Nuclear measurements were obtained for retinoblastoma (RB) (nine cases), neuroblastoma (five cases), Wilms tumor (WT) (three cases), rhabdomyosarcoma (three cases), malignant hemangiopericytoma (one case) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (one case). Among the RBs, maximum mean nuclear area percent (24.93) was seen in a case with nerve involvement and metastasis, followed by cases with only nerve involvement (21.60) and smallest area (16.57) was in non-nerve involving, nonmetastatic cases. All five cases of neuroblastoma had almost similar mean nuclear area percent (18.05-18.29). WT case with metastasis had higher nuclear area (21.25) than nonmetastatic (19.47). Amongst all the tumors, minimum value (14.93) was seen in malignant hemangiopericytoma.Morphometric evaluation in paediatric malignant round cell tumors have generated useful data, and needs further multicentric confirmation for implementation.

VDown-staging following neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer: Does timing of surgery really matter?
p3905
aVNeoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACTRT) improves local recurrence rate in locally advanced (LA) rectal cancer with no survival benefit. Pathological complete response (pCR) post-NACTRT is associated with improved outcome. Debate is ongoing as to when would be the opportune time to operate.To determine if greater down-staging can be achieved by a longer time interval from NACTRT to surgery (tumor regression score [TRS]) and whether this would impact sphincter saving surgery rates and early relapse rates.A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of patients with LA rectal adenocarcinoma treated from January 2012 to August 2013 was carried out. One hundred and ten patients who completed NACTRT (50 Gy/25 fractions with capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) twice daily) followed by surgical resection were included. For response evaluation patients were divided into two groups, Group 1 (TRS \u226460 days, n = 42) and 2 (TRS >60 days, n = 68). Tumor down-staging, pCR rate, tumor regression grade (TRG) post-NACTRT and relapse rates were correlated with TRS.Of 110 patients (median age: 49 years (21-73), 71% males; 18 (16.5%) with signet ring histology) 96% patients underwent an R0 resection. Post-NACTRT, CR was attained in 5 (4.5%), partial response in 98 (89%) and stable disease in 7 (6.4%) patients. Median time from completion of NACTRT to surgery was 64.5 days (6-474). Median lymph nodes harvested were 10 (1-50). Overall, 22 (20%) patients achieved pCR. 26 (62%) patients in Group 1 compared to 36 (53%) in Group 2 underwent sphincter sparing surgery (SSS) (P = 0.357). Six patients (14%) in Group 1 and 16 (24%) in Group 2 achieved pCR (P = 0.24). Median TRG in both groups was three.Timing of surgery following NACTRT for LA rectal cancer does not influence pathological response, ability to perform SSS or disease-free survival. There is no incremental benefit of delaying the surgery though this needs to be confirmed in a prospective randomized trial.

VIndian Council of Medical Research consensus document for the management of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
p3908
aVThis consensus statement was produced along with the gastric cancer discussions as stomach is the most common site for gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). The recommendations apply to treatment of GIST.Evaluation of a patient with newly diagnosed GIST should include essential tests: A standard white light endoscopy with 6-8 biopsies (c-KIT testing on immunohistochemistry) from the tumor for confirmation of the diagnosis, a computed tomography (CT) scan (multi-detector or helical) of the abdomen and pelvis for staging with a CT chest or chest X-ray, and complete blood counts, renal function tests and liver function tests. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/positron emission tomography (PET)-CT are not recommended for all patients.For localized and resectable disease, surgery is recommended. The need for adjuvant treatment with imatinib would be guided by the risk stratification on the histopathological analysis of the resected specimen.For localized but borderline resectable tumors, upfront surgery may be considered only if complications due to the tumor are present such as major bleeding or gastric outlet obstruction. In all other patients, neoadjuvant imatinib should be considered to downstage the disease followed by surgery (with a curative intent, if feasible) in those with stable or partial response. This may be followed by adjuvant imatinib. In those patients with a poor response, further imatinib with dose escalation or sunitinib may be considered.Patients with metastatic disease must be assessed for treatment with imatinib as first-line therapy followed by sunitinib as second-line therapy versus best supportive care on an individual basis.

Endoscopic ultrasonography/ magnetic resonance imaging/positron emission tomography-CT is not recommended for all patients.For early stage disease (IA/B, N0), surgery alone is recommended. The need for adjuvant treatment would be guided by the histopathological analysis of the resected specimen.For locally advanced stage (IB, N(+) to IIIC), neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be considered to downstage the disease followed by surgery. This may be followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (as part of the peri-operative chemotherapy regimen)Patients with stage IV/metastatic disease must be assessed for chemotherapy versus best supportive care on an individual basis.Clinical examination including history and physical examination are recommended at each follow-up visit, with a yearly CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.HER2 testing should be considered in patients with metastatic disease.5-FU may be replaced with capecitabine if patients do not have gastric outlet obstruction. Cisplatin may be replaced with oxaliplatin in the regimens.

p3916
aVDifferent additives have been used to prolong brachial plexus block. We evaluated the effect of adding magnesium sulfate to ropivacaine for supraclavicular brachial plexus blockade. The primary endpoints were the onset and duration of sensory and motor block and duration of analgesia.One hundred patients (25-55 years) posted for elective forearm and hand surgeries under supraclavicular brachial plexus block were divided into two equal groups (Groups RM and RN) in a randomized, double-blind fashion. In group RM (n = 50), 30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine plus 150 mg (in 1 ml 0.9% saline) magnesium sulfate and in group RN (n = 50), 30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine plus 1 ml normal saline were administered in supraclavicular block. Sensory and motor block onset times and block durations, time to first analgesic use, total analgesic need, postoperative visual analog scale (VAS), hemodynamic variables, and side effects were recorded for each patient.Though with similar demographic profile and block (sensory and motor) onset time, the sensory and motor block duration and time to first analgesic use were significantly longer and the total need for rescue analgesics was lower in group RM (P = 0.026) than group RN. Postoperative VAS values at 24 h were significantly lower in group RM (P = 0.045). Intraoperative hemodynamics was comparable among two groups and no appreciable side effect was noted throughout the study period.It can be concluded from this study that adding magnesium sulfate to supraclavicular brachial plexus block may increase the sensory and motor block duration and time to first analgesic use, and decrease total analgesic needs, with no side effects.

The relationship between plan complexity expressed as Modulation Complexity Score (MCS) and the gamma index analysis was established by a planar and volumetric gamma analysis of 106 clinically approved VMAT patient plans of different sites.Average volumetric 3D global gamma evaluation (3 mm/3%) results for the evaluation plans was 97.41% for 6 MV X-rays and 98.30% for 15 MV X-rays. Average MCS values for the head and neck, pelvic and thoracic plans were 0.2224, 0.3615 and 0.1874. Average volumetric 3D global gamma analysis (3 mm/3%) results for the head and neck, pelvic and thoracic VMAT plans were 95.45%, 97.51% and 96.98%, respectively. Out of 90 correlation analyses between the MCS and gamma passing rate, only 3 had the r value greater than 0.5.The Octavius 4D system is a suitable device for patient specific pretreatment QA. Global and local gamma analysis results showed a weak correlation with the MCS.

aVTherapeutic transfusion techniques such as apheresis and phlebotomy are frequently used in intensive care units. Use of the apheresis technique for the treatment of various diseases in critically ill patients is growing day by day. There are increasing evidences for using apheresis as a primary therapy or as an adjunct to other therapies for various diseases such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, haemolytic uremic syndrome, drug toxicities, autoimmune disease, sepsis and fulminant hepatic failure. Apheresis is an invasive procedure. It has significant physiologic consequences, so the care of these patients requires continuous supervision. Phlebotomy is performed as an intervention for some disease management. Its use is nowadays restricted to conditions such as polycythaemia, haemochromatosis and porphyria cutanea tarda. In this review, we have looked at various indications, procedure and complications of apheresis and phlebotomy in critical care unit.

aVHypercoagulable disorders are now diagnosed more frequently than before. These patients are, usually, managed with multiple anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications. Left unmonitored and unevaluated, there can be disastrous haemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. Appropriate perioperative and anaesthetic management of these patients will invite an aetiological diagnosis, severity analysis and the on-going treatment review. Different assays, thromboelastography and molecular cytogenetics have helped to diagnose these conditions precisely and thus guide the long-term management. Besides this, there are varieties of clinical conditions that will predispose to the hypercoagulability. These need to be defined and classified in order to offer a suitable therapeutic option. Pregnancy is one such important condition and can have more than one responsible factor favouring hypercoagulability. With such diverse kinds of disorders, it would be essential to note the anaesthetic implications, to avoid adverse perioperative outcomes. Available evidence based guidelines will help to make the therapeutic approach more precise. Selection of the appropriate technique of anaesthesia, offering the appropriate anticoagulation bridging as necessary and defining an appropriate interval and time for the intervention will help to minimise the complications.

Paediatric patients undergoing major surgery associated with substantial blood loss should be evaluated pre-operatively. Pre-operative correction of anaemia may be done considering the age, plasma volume status, clinical status and comorbidities. Maximum allowable blood loss (MABL) for surgery must be calculated, and appropriate quantity of blood and blood components should be arranged. Intraoperative monitoring of blood loss should be done, and volume of transfusion should be calculated in a protocol based manner considering the volemia and the trigger threshold for transfusion for the patient and the MABL. Early haemostasis should be achieved by judicious administration of red blood cells, blood components and pharmacological agents.

aVBlood loss and blood transfusion have been inherently associated with liver transplantation. Bleeding has been attributed to the various factors which are associated with chronic liver dysfunction. Various surgical and anaesthetic strategies have been developed over the years to reduce bleeding and also to optimise the usage of various blood and blood products perioperatively. The present day success of liver transplantation can be attributed to these issues where transfusion practices have changed. Although several centres are successfully performing liver transplantations in large numbers, there is still a large variability in the usage of blood and blood products perioperatively among the institutions and even among different anaesthesiologists from the same institution. The present article deals with the various factors confounding this concept of blood transfusion practices and the various strategies adopted to reduce the transfusion requirements in the perioperative period.

aVSepsis is a clinical syndrome characterised by systemic inflammation due to infection. There is a spectrum with severity ranging from sepsis to severe sepsis and septic shock. Even with optimal treatment, mortality due to severe sepsis or septic shock is significant and poses a challenge to management. Antibiotics, source control, resuscitation with fluids, vasopressor and inotropic agents are the main-stay of treatment for septic shock. These may be supplemented with transfusion of red blood cells and or blood products, in the case of anaemia to sustain sufficient oxygen delivery([1]) or to manage associated haematological issues. Transfusion in sepsis has always been a debatable issue, especially in relation to choice of the fluid and the role of blood or blood product transfusion.

Blood loss and assessment of its correct requirement are difficult in pregnancy due to physiological changes and comorbid conditions. Many guidelines have been used to assess the requirement and transfusion of blood and its components. Infrastructural, economic, social and religious constraints in blood banking and donation are key issues to formulate practice guidelines. Available current guidelines for transfusion are mostly from the developed world; however, they can be used by developing countries keeping available resources in perspective.

VBlood transfusion practices in neuroanaesthesia.
p3945
aVNeuroanaesthesia practice is associated with risk of significant blood loss resulting in anaemia in the intraoperative and postoperative period. The transfusion triggers in a neurologically injured brain are not clearly defined. Both a low haematocrit and a high haematocrit have not shown any improvement in the outcome. Transfusion of red blood cells may improve the cerebral oxygenation on neurophysiological monitors. However, these benefits have not been translated into clinical practice. Transfusion in subarachnoid haemorrhage leads to increased incidence of vasospasm and a poor outcome. Restrictive transfusion strategy is seen to have a lower incidence of pneumonia, urinary tract infection, bacteremia and septic shock in severe head injury. Current evidence suggests that a haemoglobin (Hb) level of <7 g/dl may be deleterious to the neurosurgical population. Target Hb of 8-9 g/dl may be desirable intraoperatively. Different transfusion triggers may hold true for different neurosurgical pathologies.

However, there is a considerable debate regarding the actual transfusion trigger at which the benefits of transfusion overweight the risk. The association between extreme haemodilution, transfusion and adverse outcome after cardio pulmonary bypass (CPB) is not clear and the current available literature is not sufficient to provide a strong recommendation regarding the safe haematocrit range during CPB. There is no quality evidence to support use of fresh red blood cell except during massive transfusion or exchange transfusion in neonate. Overall concern regarding the safety of allogeneic blood transfusion resulted in the search for autologous blood transfusion and perioperative blood salvage. The aim of this review is to provide cardiac surgery specific clinically useful guidelines pertaining to transfusion triggers, optimal haemodilution during CPB, autologous blood transfusion and role of perioperative blood salvage based on available evidence.

A search of PubMed, Google Scholar, and bibliographies of published studies were conducted using a combination of key-words. Recent articles addressing the transfusion practises in trauma from 2000 to 2014 were identified and reviewed. Trauma induced consumption and dilution of clotting factors, acidosis and hypothermia in a severely injured patient commonly causes trauma-induced coagulopathy. Early infusion of blood products and early control of bleeding decreases trauma-induced coagulopathy. Hypothermia and dilutional coagulopathy are associated with infusion of large volumes of crystalloids. Hence, the predominant focus is on damage control resuscitation, which is a combination of permissive hypotension, haemorrhage control and haemostatic resuscitation. Massive transfusion protocols improve survival in severely injured patients. Early recognition that the patient will need massive blood transfusion will limit the use of crystalloids. Initially during resuscitation, fresh frozen plasma, packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and platelets should be transfused in the ratio of 1:1:1 in severely injured patients. Fresh whole blood can be an alternative in patients who need a transfusion of 1:1:1 thawed plasma, PRBCs and platelets. Close monitoring of bleeding and point of care coagulation tests are employed, to allow goal-directed plasma, PRBCs and platelets transfusions, in order to decrease the risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury.

VDisseminated intravascular coagulation.
p3954
aVDisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a reflection of an underlying systemic disorder which affects the coagulation system, simultaneously resulting in pro-coagulant activation, fibrinolytic activation, and consumption coagulopathy and finally may result in organ dysfunction and death. Though septicaemia is the most common cause of DIC, several other conditions can also lead to it. A diagnosis of DIC should be made only in the presence of a causative factor supported by repeated laboratory tests for coagulation profile and clotting factors. An effective scoring system helps to detect an overt DIC and a high score closely correlates with mortality. Treatment of DIC is aimed at combating the underlying disorder followed by supportive management. Low molecular weight heparin is advocated in special situations whereas anti-thrombin III and activated protein C are of doubtful value. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment backed by laboratory support can reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with it. The methodology of search for this review article involved hand search from text books and internet search using Medline (via PubMed) using key words DIC, thrombosis, fibrin degradation products, anti-thrombin and tissue factor for the last 25 years and also recent evidence-based reviews.

VApproach to bleeding patient.
p3957
aVManaging a bleeding patient is very challenging for the perioperative physician. Bleeding in a patient would be due to inherited or acquired disorders of haemostasis. Identifying the patients at risk of bleeding and utilising prophylactic treatment protocols has good outcomes. Along with clinical signs, trends in monitoring coagulation parameters and analysing blood picture are necessary. Management of patients in the postoperative period and in intensive care unit should be focused on normalization of coagulation profile as early as possible with available blood and its products. Available recombinant factors should be given priority as per the approved indications. Exploring the surgical site should be considered for persistent bleeding because haemodynamic compromise, excessive transfusion of fluids, blood and its products and more inotropic support may have a negative impact on the patient outcome.

aVHaemorrhage remains a major cause of potentially preventable deaths. Rapid transfusion of large volumes of blood products is required in patients with haemorrhagic shock which may lead to a unique set of complications. Recently, protocol based management of these patients using massive transfusion protocol have shown improved outcomes. This section discusses in detail both management and complications of massive blood transfusion.

VRed blood cell transfusion strategies and Maximum surgical blood ordering schedule.
p3963
aVBlood transfusion is one of the practices that is in vogue because it expands blood volume and purportedly improves the oxygen carrying capacity. Despite this supposed physiological benefit, paradoxically, both anaemia and transfusion are independently associated with organ injury and increased morbidity. Historically, transfusion was used to maintain blood haemoglobin concentration above 10 g/dL and a haematocrit above 30%. There is now a greater emphasis on interventions to reduce the use of transfusion as it is a scarce and expensive resource with many serious adverse effects. Institutional maximum surgical blood ordering schedule algorithm developed with data analysis and consensus of surgeons, anaesthesiologists and blood banks can reduce the overuse of blood. A PubMed search was performed with search words/combination of words 'erythrocyte transfusion, adverse effects, economics, mortality, therapy, therapeutic use and utilisation'. Search yielded a total of 1541 articles that were screened for clinical relevance for the purpose of this review.

VPerioperative blood management.
p3966
aVPerioperative anaemia and allogenic blood transfusion (ABT) are known to increase the risk of adverse clinical outcomes. The quality, cost and availability of blood components are also major limitations with regard to ABT. Perioperative patient blood management (PBM) strategies should be aimed at minimizing and improving utilization of blood components. The goals of PBM are adequate preoperative evaluation and optimization of haemoglobin and bleeding parameters, techniques to minimize blood loss, blood conservation technologies and use of transfusion guidelines with targeted therapy. Attention to these details can help in cost reduction and improved patient outcome.

VLegal and ethical issues in safe blood transfusion.
p3969
aVLegal issues play a vital role in providing a framework for the Indian blood transfusion service (BTS), while ethical issues pave the way for quality. Despite licensing of all blood banks, failure to revamp the Drugs and Cosmetic Act (D and C Act) is impeding quality. Newer techniques like chemiluminescence or nucleic acid testing (NAT) find no mention in the D and C Act. Specialised products like pooled platelet concentrates or modified whole blood, therapeutic procedures like erythropheresis, plasma exchange, stem cell collection and processing technologies like leukoreduction and irradiation are not a part of the D and C Act. A highly fragmented BTS comprising of over 2500 blood banks, coupled with a slow and tedious process of dual licensing (state and centre) is a hindrance to smooth functioning of blood banks. Small size of blood banks compromises blood safety. New blood banks are opened in India by hospitals to meet requirements of insurance providers or by medical colleges as this a Medical Council of India (MCI) requirement. Hospital based blood banks opt for replacement donation as they are barred by law from holding camps. Demand for fresh blood, lack of components, and lack of guidelines for safe transfusion leads to continued abuse of blood. Differential pricing of blood components is difficult to explain scientifically or ethically. Accreditation of blood banks along with establishment of regional testing centres could pave the way to blood safety. National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) and National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) deserve a more proactive role in the licensing process. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) needs to clarify that procedures or tests meant for enhancement of blood safety are not illegal.

VTransfusion transmitted diseases in perioperative and intensive care settings.
p3972
aVPatients in the perioperative period and intensive care unit are commonly exposed to blood transfusion (BT). They are at increased risk of transfusion transmitted bacterial, viral and protozoal diseases. The risk of viral transmission has decreased steadily, but the risk of bacterial transmission remains same. Bacterial contamination is more in platelet concentrates than in red cells and least in plasma. The chances of sepsis, morbidity and mortality depend on the number of transfusions and underlying condition of the patient. Challenges to safe BT continue due to new emerging pathogens and various management problems. Strategies to restrict BT, optimal surgical and anaesthetic techniques to reduce blood loss and efforts to develop transfusion alternatives should be made. Literature search was performed using search words/phrases blood transfusion, transfusion, transfusion transmitted diseases, transfusion transmitted bacterial diseases, transfusion transmitted viral diseases, transfusion transmitted protozoal diseases or combinations, on PubMed and Google Scholar from 1990 to 2014.

VAdverse events related to blood transfusion.
p3975
aVThe acute blood transfusion reactions are responsible for causing most serious adverse events. Awareness about various clinical features of acute and delayed transfusion reactions with an ability to assess the serious reactions on time can lead to a better prognosis. Evidence-based medicine has changed today's scenario of clinical practice to decrease adverse transfusion reactions. New evidence-based algorithms of transfusion and improved haemovigilance lead to avoidance of unnecessary transfusions perioperatively. The recognition of adverse events under anaesthesia is always challenging. The unnecessary blood transfusions can be avoided with better blood conservation techniques during surgery and with anaesthesia techniques that reduce blood loss. Better and newer blood screening methods have decreased the infectious complications to almost negligible levels. With universal leukoreduction of red blood cells (RBCs), selection of potential donors such as use of male donors only plasma and restriction of RBC storage, most of the non-infectious complications can be avoided.

VIndications for blood and blood product transfusion.
p3978
aVTransfusion of blood products carries certain inherent risks and hence it should be undertaken only if it improves patient outcome. A review of the literature was carried out to find the indications and effects of transfusion on morbidity and mortality of patients. There is high-quality evidence showing that restrictive blood transfusion with a transfusion trigger of haemoglobin of 7-8 g/dl or the presence of symptoms of anaemia is safe and not associated with increased mortality compared with liberal transfusion. Thus, restrictive strategy is strongly recommended in surgical and critically ill-patients. There is moderate evidence for the use of plasma and platelet transfusion in patients receiving massive blood transfusion. There is not enough evidence to support the use of plasma, platelets and cryoprecipitate in any other clinical setting. Retrospective studies show improved survival after high plasma and platelet to red blood cell ratio of 1:1:1, but this has not been confirmed in randomised trials.

VOverview of blood components and their preparation.
p3981
aVThe whole blood which is a mixture of cells, colloids and crystalloids can be separated into different blood components namely packed red blood cell (PRBC) concentrate, platelet concentrate, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate. Each blood component is used for a different indication; thus the component separation has maximized the utility of one whole blood unit. Different components need different storage conditions and temperature requirements for therapeutic efficacy. A variety of equipments to maintain suitable ambient conditions during storage and transportation are in vogue. The blood components being foreign to a patient may produce adverse effects that may range from mild allergic manifestations to fatal reactions. Such reactions are usually caused by plasma proteins, leucocytes, red cell antigens, plasma and other pathogens. To avoid and reduce such complications, blood products are modified as leukoreduced products, irradiated products, volume reduced products, saline washed products and pathogen inactivated products. The maintenance of blood inventory forms a major concern of blood banking particularly of rare blood groups routinely and common blood groups during disasters. PRBCs can be stored for years using cryopreservation techniques. New researches in red cell cultures and blood substitutes herald new era in blood banking.

VBlood groups systems.
p3984
aVInternational Society of Blood Transfusion has recently recognized 33 blood group systems. Apart from ABO and Rhesus system, many other types of antigens have been noticed on the red cell membranes. Blood grouping and cross-matching is one of the few important tests that the anaesthesiologist orders during perioperative period. Hence, a proper understanding of the blood group system, their clinical significance, typing and cross-matching tests, and current perspective are of paramount importance to prevent transfusion-related complications. Nonetheless, the knowledge on blood group system is necessary to approach blood group-linked diseases which are still at the stage of research. This review addresses all these aspects of the blood groups system.

VOverview of the coagulation system.
p3987
aVCoagulation is a dynamic process and the understanding of the blood coagulation system has evolved over the recent years in anaesthetic practice. Although the traditional classification of the coagulation system into extrinsic and intrinsic pathway is still valid, the newer insights into coagulation provide more authentic description of the same. Normal coagulation pathway represents a balance between the pro coagulant pathway that is responsible for clot formation and the mechanisms that inhibit the same beyond the injury site. Imbalance of the coagulation system may occur in the perioperative period or during critical illness, which may be secondary to numerous factors leading to a tendency of either thrombosis or bleeding. A systematic search of literature on PubMed with MeSH terms 'coagulation system, haemostasis and anaesthesia revealed twenty eight related clinical trials and review articles in last 10 years. Since the balance of the coagulation system may tilt towards bleeding and thrombosis in many situations, it is mandatory for the clinicians to understand physiologic basis of haemostasis in order to diagnose and manage the abnormalities of the coagulation process and to interpret the diagnostic tests done for the same.

VHeavy metals [chromium (VI) and lead (II)] removal from water using mesoporous magnetite (Fe3O4) nanospheres.
p3995
aVMagnetite nanospheres with hollow interiors were synthesized using a simple, one-pot, and template free solvothermal method with ferric chloride as the iron precursor. The composition, surface properties and morphology were studied using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), surface area analysis, point of zero charge (pHpzc), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and magnetic moment determination. These mesoporous nanospheres have a SBET=11.3m(2)/g and a high saturation magnetization of 77.5emu/g. These magnetite nanospheres successfully remediated Cr(6+) and Pb(2+) from water. The optimum pHs for Cr(6+) and Pb(2+) adsorption were 4.0 and 5.0, respectively. Adsorption was carried out at 25, 35 and 45°C. The sorption data were fitted using Freundlich, Langmuir, Redlich-Peterson, Sips, Koble-Corrigan, Radke and Prausnitz and Toth adsorption models. The pseudo-second order model better fitted the kinetics data. The Langmuir adsorption capacities of magnetic nanospheres were \u223c9 and \u223c19mg/g for Cr(6+) and Pb(2)(+), respectively. Magnetic collection of these magnetite nanospheres can be used to isolate and regenerate the used adsorbent.

VApplication of design of experiment for polyox and xanthan gum coated floating pulsatile delivery of sumatriptan succinate in migraine treatment.
p3998
aVMigraine follows circadian rhythm in which headache is more painful at the awakening time. This needs administration of dosage form at night time to release drug after lag period when pain gets worse. Sumatriptan succinate is a drug of choice for migraine. Sumatriptan succinate has bitter taste, low oral bioavailability, and shorter half-life. Present work deals with application of design of experiment for polyox and xanthan gum in development of press coated floating pulsatile tablet. Floating pulsatile concept was applied to increase gastric residence of the dosage form. Burst release was achieved through immediate release tablet using crospovidone as superdisintegrant (10%). Pulse lag time was achieved using swellable polymer polyox WSR 205 and xanthan gum. 3(2) experimental design was applied. Optimized formulation was evaluated for physical characteristics and in-vitro and in-vivo study. From results, it can be concluded that optimized batch F8 containing polyox WSR205 (72.72%) and xanthan gum (27.27%) of total weight of polymer has shown floating lag time of 55 ± 2\u2009sec, drug content of 100.35 ± 0.4%, hardness of 6 ± 0.1\u2009Kg/cm(2), and 98.69 ± 2% drug release in pulse manner with lag time of 7 ± 0.1\u2009h. Optimized batch showed prolong gastric residence which was confirmed by in-vivo X-ray study.

aVAim. EMBRACE(TM) is an innovative, low cost infant warmer for use in neonates. It contains phase change material, which stays at constant temperature for 6 hours. We surveyed paediatricians using EMBRACE(TM) regarding benefits, risks, and setup in which it was used in Gujarat. Methods. Questionnaire was administered telephonically to 52 out of 53 paediatricians. Results. EMBRACE(TM) was used for an average of 8.27 (range of 3-18, SD = 3.84) months by paediatricians. All used it for thermoregulation during transfers, for average (SD) duration of 42 (0.64)\u2009m per transfer, 62.7% used it at mother's side for average (SD) 11.06 (7.89)\u2009h per day, and 3.9% prescribed it at home. It was used in low birth weight neonates only by 56.9% while 43.1% used it for all neonates. While hyperthermia was not reported, 5.9% felt that EMBRACE(TM) did not prevent hypothermia. About 54.9% felt that they could not monitor the newborn during EMBRACE(TM) use. Of paediatricians who practiced kangaroo mother care (KMC), 7.7% have limited/stopped/decreased the practice of KMC and substituted it with EMBRACE(TM). Conclusions. EMBRACE(TM) was acceptable to most but concerns related to monitoring neonates and disinfection remained. Most paediatricians felt that it did not hamper KMC practice.

VCost analysis of three techniques of administering sevoflurane.
p4004
aVBackground. This study aimed to evaluate and compare total cost of sevoflurane and propofol for 1.0 MAC-hour of anaesthesia, employing three anaesthetic techniques. Methods. Adult patients scheduled for surgical procedures under general anaesthesia anticipated to last approximately an hour were randomized into three groups (n = 15 each), to receive anaesthesia using one of the following techniques: low flow technique involving induction with propofol, followed by sevoflurane delivered using initial fresh gas flows of 6\u2009L/min till MAC reached 1.0 and then reduced to 0.5\u2009L/min; alternate method of low flow entailing only a difference in fresh gas flow rates being maintained at 1\u2009L/min throughout; the third technique involving use of sevoflurane for both induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. Results. Cost of sevoflurane to maintain 1 MAC-hour of anaesthesia was clinically least with low flow anaesthesia, though statistically similar amongst the three techniques. Once the cost of propofol used for induction in two of the three groups was added to that of sevoflurane, cost incurred was least with the technique using sevoflurane both for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia, as compared to low flow and alternative low flow techniques, a 26% and 32% cost saving, respectively (P < 0.05).

VA simple planning technique of craniospinal irradiation in the eclipse treatment planning system.
p4007
aVA new planning method for Craniospinal Irradiation by Eclipse treatment planning system using Field alignment, Field-in-Field technique was developed. Advantage of this planning method was also studied retrospectively for previously treated five patients of medulloblastoma with variable spine length. Plan consists of half beam blocked parallel opposed cranium, and a single posterior cervicospine field was created by sharing the same isocenter, which obviates divergence matching. Further, a single symmetrical field was created to treat remaining Lumbosacral spine. Matching between a inferior diverging edge of cervicospine field and superior diverging edge of a Lumbosacral field was done using the field alignment option. 'Field alignment' is specific option in the Eclipse Treatment Planning System, which automatically matches the field edge divergence as per field alignment rule. Multiple segments were applied in both the spine field to manage with hot and cold spots created by varying depth of spinal cord. Plan becomes fully computerized using this field alignment option and multiple segments. Plan evaluation and calculated mean modified Homogeneity Index (1.04 and 0.1) ensured that dose to target volume is homogeneous and critical organ doses were within tolerance. Dose variation at the spinal field junction was verified using ionization chamber array (I'MatriXX) for matched, overlapped and gap junction spine fields; the delivered dose distribution confirmed the ideal clinical match, over exposure and under exposure at the junction, respectively. This method is simple to plan, executable in Record and Verify mode and can be adopted for various length of spinal cord with only two isocenter in shorter treatment time.

VDose verification in carcinoma of uterine cervix patients undergoing 3D conformal radiotherapy with Farmer type ion chamber.
p4010
aVExternal beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for carcinoma of uterine cervix is a basic line of treatment with three dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) in large number of patients. There is need for an established method for verification dosimetry. We tried to document absorbed doses in a group of carcinoma cervix patients by inserting a 0.6 cc Farmer type ion chamber in the vaginal cavity. A special long perspex sleeve cap is designed to cover the chamber for using in the patient's body. Response of ionization chamber is checked earlier in water phantom with and without cap. Treatment planning was carried out with X-ray computed tomography (CT) scan and with the chamber along with cap in inserted position, and with the images Xio treatment planning system. Three measurements on 3 days at 5-6 fraction intervals were recorded in 12 patients. Electrometer measured charges are converted to absorbed dose at the chamber center, in vivo. Our results show good agreement with planned dose within 3% against prescribed dose. This study, is a refinement over our previous studies with transmission dosimetry and chemicals in ampules. This preliminary work shows promise that this can be followed as a routine dose check with special relevance to new protocols in the treatment of carcinoma cervix with EBRT.

p4013
aVThe objective of this study was to analyze the influence of the increment of gantry angle and the number of arcs on esophageal volumetric modulated arc therapy plan. All plans were done in Monaco planning system for Elekta Synergy linear accelerator with 80 multileaf collimator (MLC). Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were done with different increment of gantry angle like 15°, 20°, 30° and 40°. The remaining parameters were similar for all the plans. The results were compared. To compare the plan quality with number of arcs, VMAT plans were done with single and dual arc with increment of gantry angle of 20°. The dose to gross tumor volume (GTV) for 60 Gy and planning target volume (PTV) for 48 Gy was compared. The dosimetric parameters D98%, D95%, D50% and Dmax of GTV were analyzed. The homogeneity index (HI) and conformity index (CI) of GTV were studied and the dose to 98% and 95% of PTV was analyzed. Maximum dose to spinal cord and planning risk volume of cord (PRV cord) was compared. The Volume of lung receiving 10 Gy, 20 Gy and mean dose was analyzed. The volume of heart receiving 30 Gy and 45 Gy was compared. The volume of normal tissue receiving greater than 2 Gy and 5 Gy was compared. The number of monitor units (MU) required to deliver the plans were compared. The plan with larger increment of gantry angle proved to be superior to smaller increment of gantry angle plans in terms of dose coverage, HI, CI and normal tissue sparing. The number of arcs did not make any difference in the quality of the plan.

VNeutron dose estimation via LET spectrometry using CR-39 detector for the reaction (9)Be (p, n).
p4016
aVCR-39 detectors, widely used for neutron dosimetry in accelerator radiation environment, have also been applied in tissue microdosimetry by generating the linear energy transfer (LET) spectrum. In this work, the neutron dose has been estimated via LET spectrometry for (9)Be (p, n) reaction which is useful for personnel monitoring around particle accelerators and accelerator based therapy facilities. Neutrons were generated by the interaction of protons of 6 different energies from 4-24 MeV with a thick Be target. The LET spectra were obtained from the major and minor radii of each track and the thickness of removed surface. From the LET spectra, the absorbed dose (D LET) and the dose equivalent (H LET) were estimated using Q-L relationship as given by International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) 60. The track density in CR-39 detector and hence the neutron yield was found to be increasing with the increase in projectile (proton) energy. Similar observations were also obtained for absorbed dose (D LET) and dose equivalents (H LET).

p4019
aVMedical electron linear accelerators with the capability of generating unflat photon (flattening filter-free, FFF) beams are also available commercially for clinical applications in radiotherapy. However, the beam characteristics evaluation criteria and parameters are not yet available for such photon beams. Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) of India constituted a Task Group comprising experts from regulatory agency, advisory body/research and technical institutions, and clinical radiotherapy centers in the country to evolve and recommend the acceptance criteria for the flattening filter-free (FFF) photon beams. The Task Group thoroughly reviewed the literature and inputs of the manufactures/suppliers of the FFF linac and recommended a set of dosimetry parameters for evaluating the characteristics of the unflat photon beam. The recommendations included the evaluation of quality index, degree of unflatness, difference in percentage surface dose between flat and unflat photon beams, percentage depth dose at 10 cm depth, off-axis-ratios and radiation beam penumbra. The recommended parameters were evaluated for FFF photon beams generated by three different models of the linac, and it was observed that recommended evaluation methods are simple and easy to be implemented with the existing dosimetry and quality assurance infrastructure of the linac facilities of the radiotherapy departments. Recommendations were also made for periodic quality control check of the unflat photon beams and constancy evaluation in the beam characteristics.

aVCognitive impairment has long been recognized as a co-morbidity or sequel to refractory epilepsy. This study was conducted to evaluate the degree and selectivity of involvement of memory, language and executive functions performance among patients with temporal (TLE) versus extratemporal epilepsy (ETLE).We prospectively enrolled adolescent and adult patients with medically refractory focal epilepsy, who had undergone pre-surgical evaluation. Language, memory and executive function assessment was done using Western Aphasia Battery, PGI memory scale and battery of four executive function tests (trail making test A & B, digit symbol test, Stroop Task and verbal fluency test), respectively.Among102 patients enrolled (TLE-59, ETLE-43), mean age of patients 23.0 4± 8.3 years, 83 (82%) had impairment of more than one cognitive domain and 21 (21%) had all three domains involved. Severely impaired memory scores were found in 8.6% patients with MTLE-HS, 8% of the rest of the patients with TLE and 7% patients with ETLE. The differences in the mean scores were also not found statistically significant (p=0.669). Naming impairment was the most common language abnormality, although all aphasia subscores were similar for the ETLE and TLE groups. Executive function impairment was the most common cognitive domain affected. Overall performance on executive function tests was found impaired in almost all patients of both groups without any significant inter-group difference, except on Trail-A test, which revealed better results in patients with mTLE-HS as compared to all other sub-groups.Our study shows that impairment of memory, language and executive function is common among patients with drug refractory epilepsy. The most prevalent impairment is in executive function. There is no significant difference in the degree, prevalence or selectivity of impairment in either of the three domains, between the TLE versus ETLE groups.

VDexmedetomidine anesthesia enhances spike generation during intra-operative electrocorticography: A promising adjunct for epilepsy surgery.
p4027
aVAnesthetic-induced suppression of cortical electrical activity is a major concern during epilepsy surgery. Dexmedetomidine (Dex) has been recently evaluated in a few small series for its effect on the electrocorticographic spikes intra-operatively.In this prospective study, electrocorticogram (ECoG) was monitored during dexmedetomidine infusion in 34 patients (M:F=23:11, age=29.2 ± 10.9 years; duration of epilepsy=15.3 ± 8.9 years) undergoing anterior temporal lobe resection with amygdalo-hippocampectomy for drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (Right: 18, Left: 16). Anesthesia was induced with thiopental/propofol and maintained with oxygen-N2O-isoflurane. ECoG was recorded for 5 min after the end tidal MAC of N2O and isoflurane were decreased to zero; anesthesia was maintained with O2:Air=50:50, vecuronium and fentanyl. ECoG was recorded using a 4-contact strip electrode for: (a) 5 min prior to dexmedetomidine (PreDEX), (b) 5 min during dexmedetomidine infusion (DEX; 1 \u03bcg/kg) and (c) 5 min after stopping dexmedetomidine (PostDEX).The ECoG spikes were manually counted in all the channels. The mean spike rate in the 2 channels with maximum spikes (MAX CH A and MAX CH B) was normalized to a 3-min duration. RM-ANOVA and post hoc comparison of three phases were used to compare the spike rates. The mean spike rate during Dex phase was higher compared to preDEX (MAX CH B: p=0.007 and MAX CH A: p=0.079) and PostDEX (MAX CH B: p=0.17, MAX CH A: p=0.79) phases. The spike rate increased in 67.6% patients, while 11.8% patients showed \u2264 25% reduction and 20.6% patients showed >25% reduction in spike frequency.Dexmedetomidine is useful during intra-operative ECoG recording in epilepsy surgery as it enhances or does not alter spike rate in most of the cases, without any major adverse effects.

Pre cooling scores of Crossed Over Hop Test of the dominant leg in the subjects was 174.14 (± 8.60) cm and post cooling scores of the dominant leg was 174.45 (± 9.28) cm. Pre cooling scores of Weight Discrimination Differential Threshold of the dominant leg in the subjects was 1.625 ± 1.179 kg compared with post cooling scores of the dominant leg 1.85 (± 1.91) kg. Pre cooling scores of single leg hop and crossed over hop test of the dominant leg in the subjects compared with post cooling scores of the dominant leg showed no significant differences and it was also noted that the weight discrimination ability (weight discrimination differential threshold) didn't show any significant difference. All the values are reported as mean ± SD.This study provides additional evidence that proprioceptive acuity in the hamstring muscles (biceps femoris) remains largely unaffected after ice application to the hamstrings tendon (biceps femoris).

p4033
aVTo determine the 2D:4D ratio in elite Indian male kabaddi players and compare them with non-athletes.Our study was undertaken to find out a possible relation between digit ratio and sporting ability of male kabaddi players. This study also gives an insight into the possible ethnic differences between Indian sports personnel and other populations.Both right and left hands of 33 male kabaddi players attending training camp at the Bangalore regional centre of Sports Authority of India were scanned. Lengths of second and fourth digits were measured and their ratio calculated. Age, weight, height and body mass index matched subjects (25 males) who did not participate in any sports formed the control group.A highly significant difference was found in 2D:4D ratios of both the hands with Kabaddi players having a lower ratio compared to their controls. There was no statistically significant difference in 2D:4D (\u0394 r-l) between Kabaddi players and controls.Kabaddi is an intermediate sport not requiring a high level of endurance but at the same time requires masculine traits because of combating nature of the game. 2D:4D ratios can be used as reliable additional criteria when screening for prospective players to be inducted into the team.

VEffect of preconditioning by light load eccentric exercise versus heat on markers of muscle damage in collegiate males.
p4036
aVDelayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) occurs following unaccustomed or intense bouts of exercise. Previous research has demonstrated that that preconditioning with low load exercise or heat relieves muscle soreness. However, actively warming up the muscles with exercise may be an effective alternative.This study compared preconditioning effect of light load eccentric exercise and heat using microwave diathermy on markers of muscle damage in collegiate males.Thirty six sedentary collegiate males were randomly assigned into two experimental groups: 10% Eccentric exercise group (10% ECC group) and Microwave diathermy group (MWD group). Both the groups performed 30 repetitions of maximal eccentric exercise (Max-ECC) of the elbow flexors. The 10% ECC group performed light load eccentric exercise (10% ECC), five sets, six repetitions using a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength (MVC), 2 days prior to Max-ECC. The MWD group received heat using microwave diathermy (150 watts, 20 minutes) one day prior to Max-ECC. Changes in MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference, soreness, were assessed before and 24-72 hours after whereas serum creatine kinase activity and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity up to 48 hours following the Max-ECC were compared between groups by a mixed model ANOVA.No significant difference (P > 0.05) were found between the groups for changes in all variables post Max-ECC, except for LDH activity showing significant interaction effect (P = 0.04).Preconditioning with light load eccentric exercise and heat using microwave diathermy treatment did not differ in their effects on muscle damage markers after Max-ECC. However, with time their effects on LDH activity were found to be different.

aVOral and dental injuries contribute to a major part of sports related injuries in children. Trauma occurring in developing years disrupts normal social functioning and brings about a major impact on quality of life due to their cumulative effect.To assess the prevalence and causes of various sports related traumatic orodental injuries among 8 to 16 year school students along with identifying the associated risk factors in North India.A cross sectional study consisting of high school students of different organized sports teams aged 8-16 years was carried out in geographical area of north India. The students were selected by multistage cluster sampling methodology. 1105 students from 19 school teams (sports teams) and sports academies participated in study through structured interview and clinical examination in different sports situations.30.3% (n = 335) of students suffered from orodental injuries. A higher number of girls had injury (32%) than boys (29%), though the difference was not significant. Most of the students suffered from soft tissue injuries (48%) followed by tooth fractures (43%). Maximum numbers of injuries were reported in high velocity (44.1%) and medium intensity sports (46.6%) (P < 0.001) Maximum injuries occurred in basketball (50%) and lowest in the field of badminton (6.1%) (P < 0.05). Amateurs (52%) suffered the most from injuries as per level of coaching. Only 6% of boys and 2% of girls used mouthguards.The result of the present study confirmed that students participating in different organized sports at high school level are at a very high risk of getting orodental injury. Hence knowledge and education regarding prevention of traumatic injuries is of paramount importance.

p4045
aVCetirizine dihydrochloride, a pharmaceutical drug of the class antihistamines is frequently detected in wastewater samples. In the present work, the degradation of Cetirizine dihydrochloride is carried out using a novel technique of laccase enzyme as a catalyst under the influence of ultrasound irradiation. Effect of various process parameters such as enzyme loading, temperature, power, duty cycle, frequency and speed of agitation has been studied along with identification of the degradation intermediates. The maximum degradation of 91% is achieved at optimized experimental parameters such as 0.02% enzyme loading (w/v), 50°C temperature, power input of 100 W, 25 kHz frequency and 50% duty cycle with agitation speed of 200 rpm. It is observed that enzymatic degradation of Cetirizine dihydrochloride under the influence of ultrasound irradiation not only enhances the degradation but also reduces the time of degradation as compared to conventional enzymatic degradation technique.

p4051
aVMutations in exon 1 of ARHGAP29, a RhoA specific GTPase have been identified in North American and Filipino subjects with nonsyndromic cleft palate and cleft lip with or without cleft palate. Since the genetic status of ARHGAP29 in Indian subjects with nonsyndromic oral clefts is not known, we designed the present study to investigate the occurrence of the above mutations in them.Total genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood of 60 subjects with nonsyndromic cleft palate and cleft lip with or without cleft palate, and equal number of control healthy subjects were amplified with primers flanking exon 1 of ARHGAP29 gene and subjected to direct sequencing.Sequencing analysis identified a nonsense mutation in exon 1 of ARHGAP29 that caused substitution of lysine to stop codon at codon position 32 in a subject with nonsyndromic cleft lip with cleft palate. The mutation, however, occurred in heterozygous condition. None of the other subjects carried mutation in this region.The study has thus identified a rare but novel truncation mutation in ARHGAP29 gene for the first time in nonsyndromic oral clefts.

aVLeptin is a polypeptide hormone associated with the occurrence of legion of diseases including obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. Periodontitis, that is, inflammation of the periodontium has also been linked to a number of systemic manifestations.The aim of the present study was to analyze the role of leptin as a biomarker linking periodontitis with obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes.The inclusion criteria included, clinical trials available in English language; studies involving human participants; studies relating leptin and periodontal diseases to either obesity, cardiovascular diseases or diabetes. Exclusion criteria enlisted manuscripts in language other than English; if they were case reports, narrative reviews, personal communication, conference presentations, editorial and expert opinion; experiments not involving humans.We performed a literature search encompassing the time period from January 2000 to May 2013. A systematic search of the Cochrane Library and the Medline through PubMed was performed using the selected keywords/phrases "leptin and periodontitis," "leptin and periodontal diseases," "leptin, periodontitis and obesity," "leptin, periodontitis and cardiovascular diseases," and "leptin, periodontitis, and diabetes."A total of 23 studies was obtained using the selected keywords/phrases. On screening, the chosen studies seven fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Four demonstrated association of leptin with periodontitis and obesity. One study associated cardiovascular diseases and periodontitis through leptin whereas two were found linking leptin, periodontitis, and diabetes mellitus.We could find some positive consociation between the serum concentration of leptin, periodontitis, and systemic diseases including obesity and cardiovascular diseases. The results were conflicting when its relation with diabetes mellitus type 2 was examined, as one study favored the association whereas the other one claimed that there was no effect on the levels of leptin.

aVThe aim of this study was to understand the tobacco consumption patterns and their relationship with life course socioeconomic mobility among fish industry workers as this could provide important information in dealing with the tobacco problem in this very vulnerable population.Socioeconomic life course data and information about tobacco habits was collected from 102 fish industry workers. A subject was considered to be upwardly mobile if the family head's educational attainment and the number of earning members increased and the number of children and dependents decreased since childhood in his or her household. Oral examination was also done for malignant/premalignant lesions.Of the 102 subjects, 64 regularly consumed tobacco either in smoking or smokeless forms and the common reasons for the habit were the co-workers' influence and to keep awake at work. Fourteen subjects had premalignant lesions in the oral cavity and all them were in the buccal mucosa. The prevalence of the tobacco habit was much lesser (25%) among the upwardly mobile group when compared to the minimal or no improvement group (75%). A majority of those free from the habit (73.7%) were belonging to the group, which showed improved educational attainment. Among those with good social mobility, the percentage of workers with high frequency of tobacco consumption and those with a longer duration of the tobacco habit was low when compared to the minimal social mobility group.A holistic approach consisting of efforts to improve the overall socioeconomic conditions can be more effective than piecemeal solutions in dealing with the tobacco menace.

aVAbundant resources and techniques have been used for complete coverage crown fabrication. Conventional investing and casting procedures for phosphate-bonded investments require a 2- to 4-h procedure before completion. Accelerated casting techniques have been used, but may not result in castings with matching marginal accuracy.The study measured the marginal gap and determined the clinical acceptability of single cast copings invested in a phosphate-bonded investment with the use of conventional and accelerated methods.One hundred and twenty cast coping samples were fabricated using conventional and accelerated methods, with three finish lines: Chamfer, shoulder and shoulder with bevel. Sixty copings were prepared with each technique. Each coping was examined with a stereomicroscope at four predetermined sites and measurements of marginal gaps were documented for each.A master chart was prepared for all the data and was analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version. Evidence of marginal gap was then evaluated by t-test. Analysis of variance and Post-hoc analysis were used to compare two groups as well as to make comparisons between three subgroups .Measurements recorded showed no statistically significant difference between conventional and accelerated groups.Among the three marginal designs studied, shoulder with bevel showed the best marginal fit with conventional as well as accelerated casting techniques. Accelerated casting technique could be a vital alternative to the time-consuming conventional casting technique. The marginal fit between the two casting techniques showed no statistical difference.

aVPeriodontal disease is an immune-inflammatory disease characterized by connective tissue breakdown, loss of attachment, and alveolar bone resorption. Under normal physiological conditions, a dynamic equilibrium is maintained between the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defense capacity. Oxidative stress occurs when this equilibrium shifts in favor of ROS. Oxidative stress is thought to play a causative role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.The present study was designed to estimate and compare the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) levels in the serum of periodontitis, gingivitis, and healthy individuals before and after nonsurgical periodontal therapy.The present study was conducted in the Department of Periodontics, A. B. Shetty Memorial Institute of Dental Sciences, Deralakatte, Mangalore. The study was designed as a single blinded interventional study comprising 75 subjects, inclusive of both sexes and divided into three groups of 25 patients each. Patients were categorized into chronic periodontitis, gingivitis, and healthy. The severity of inflammation was assessed using gingival index and pocket probing depth. Biochemical analysis was done to estimate the SOD and GSH levels before and after nonsurgical periodontal therapy. RESULTS obtained were then statistically analyzed using ANOVA test and paired t-test.The results showed a higher level of serum SOD and GSH in the healthy group compared to the other groups. The difference was found to be statistically significant (P < 0.0001). The post-treatment levels of SOD were statistically higher than the pre-treatment levels in periodontitis and gingivitis group.

The root canals were prepared to a master apical size of number 50 using step back technique. Depending upon the intracanal medicament used, the teeth were divided randomly into five groups of 10 teeth each including one control group and four experimental groups. Group A: No intracanal medicament. Group B: Calcium hydroxide powder mixed with distilled water. Group C: Calcium hydroxide gutta percha points (calcium hydroxide points). Group D: 1% chlorhexidine gel (hexigel). Group E: Chlorhexidine gutta percha points (Roeko Activ Points). The medication was left in canals for 14 days. Following removal of the intracanal medicament, all the groups were obturated with lateral compaction technique. The apical leakage was then evaluated using dye extraction method with the help of a spectrophotometer.RESULTS were statistically analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-test, which showed statistically significant difference among the five groups tested.It can be concluded from this study that the control group showed least amount of leakage, whereas the 1% chlorhexidine gel group showed maximum amount of leakage. Apical leakage was observed with all the experimental groups with little variations in between them. Under the parameters of this study, it can be concluded that use of intracanal medicaments during endodontic treatment has a definite impact on the apical seal of the root canal system.

aVBone grafts are frequently used in the treatment of bone defects. Bone harvesting can cause postoperative complications and sometimes does not provide a sufficient quantity of bone. Therefore, synthetic biomaterials have been investigated as an alternative to autogenous bone grafts.The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare bovine derived hydroxyapatite (BHA) and synthetic hydroxyapatite (SHA) graft material as bone graft substitute in maxillary cystic bony defects. Patients were analyzed by computerized densitometric study and digital radiography.In this study, 12 patients in each group were included randomly after clinical and radiological evaluation. The integration of hydroxyapatite was assessed with mean bone density, surgical site margin, and radiological bone formation characteristics, of the successful graft cases using computer densitometry and radio-visiograph. Statistical analysis was carried out using Mann-Whitney U-test, Wilcoxon matched pairs test and paired t-test.By the end of 24 th week, the grafted defects radiologically and statistically showed similar volumes of bone formation. However, the significant changes observed in the formation of bone and merging of material and surgical site margin at 1 st week to 1 st month. The results were significant and correlating with all the parameters showing the necessity of the grafting for early bone formation. However, the bone formation pattern is different in both BHA and SHA group at 3 rd month interval with significant P value.Both BHA and SHA graft materials are biocompatible for filling bone defects, showing less resorption and enhanced bone formation with similar efficacy. Our study showed maximum bone healing within 12 weeks of grafting of defects. The BHA is economical; however, price difference between the two is very nominal.

p4098
aVHeat shock proteins-47 (HSP47) is a collagen specific molecular chaperone, involved in the processing and/or secretion of procollagen. It seems to be regularly upregulated in various fibrotic or collagen disorders. Hence, this protein can be a potential target for the treatment of various fibrotic diseases including oral submucous fibrosis (OSF), which is a collagen metabolic disorder of oral cavity and whose etiopathogeneic mechanism and therapeutic protocols are still not well documented.The aim of this study is to identify the novel therapeutic agents using in-silico methods for the management of OSF.The objectives of this study are to identify the binding sites of HSP47 on the collagen molecule and to identify the lead compound with anti-HSP47 activity from the library of natural compounds, using in-silico methodology.The web-based and tool based in-silico analysis of the HSP47 and collagen molecules are used in this study. The crystal structure of collagen and HSP47 were retrieved from Protein Data Bank website. The binding site identification and the docking studies are done using Molegro Virtual Docker offline tool.Out of the 104 Natural compounds, six ligands are found to possess best binding affinity to the binding amino acid residues. Silymarin binds with the 4AU2A receptor and the energy value are found to be -178.193 with four Hbonds. The other best five natural compounds are hesperidin, ginkgolides, withanolides, resveratrol, and gingerol. Our findings provide the basis for the in-vitro validation of the above specified compounds, which can possibly act as "lead" molecules in designing the drugs for OSF.HSP47 can be a potential candidate to target, in order to control the production of abundance collagen in OSF. Hence, the binding sites of HSP47 with collagen are identified and some natural compounds with a potential to bind with these binding receptors are also recognized. These natural compounds might act as anti-HSP47 lead molecules in designing novel therapeutic agents for OSF, which are so far unavailable.

VImmunolocalization of heme oxygenase-1 in periodontal diseases.
p4101
aVChronic periodontitis is an inflammatory condition of supporting tissues initiated by organisms in dental plaque. The reactive oxygen species and free radicals mediate connective tissue destruction in periodontitis. In order to counteract the free radical mediated tissue damage, numerous antioxidant mechanisms exist within the host. One such system is heme oxygenase enzymes. Heme oxygenase is the key enzyme involved in catabolism of heme. It cleaves the heme molecule to yield equimolar amounts of biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and iron. These end products act as important scavengers of reactive oxygen metabolites. Increased heme oxygenase expression has been identified in inflammatory condition, such as pancreatitis, diabetes, nephritis, and atherosclerosis. Since chronic periodontitis is one such inflammatory condition, we assessed the expression of heme oxygenase-1, in smokers and periodontitis group using immunohistochemistry technique.The aim of this study is to compare the expression of heme oxygenase-1 in patients with healthy periodontium, periodontitis and smokers.Gingival tissue samples were taken from 30 patients, who were divided into three groups healthy controls (n = 10), chronic periodontitis (n = 10), and smokers with chronic periodontitis (n = 10). All the samples were subjected to immunohistochemical staining using the antiheme oxygenase-1 antibody and were tested for efficiency by staining a positive control (prostate cancer tissue sections) and a negative control. The results were tabulated and analyzed.Our results showed increased expression of heme oxygenase-1 in the gingival tissue samples taken from smokers compared with periodontitis and healthy tissue.The results of our study is an increasing evidence of involvement of antioxidant enzymes like heme oxygenase-1 in periodontal inflammation and their implication for treatment of chronic periodontitis.

VDevelopment and validation of oral health-related early childhood quality of life tool for North Indian preschool children.
p4104
aVThe purpose of this study was to develop a reliable instrument [Oral Health related Early Childhood Quality of Life (OH- ECQOL) scale] for measuring oral health related quality of life (OHrQoL) in preschool children in North Indian population.Four pediatric dentists evaluated a pool of 65 items from various QoL questionnaires to assess their relevance to Indian population. These items were discussed with eight independent pediatric dentists and two community dentists who were not a part of this study to assess relevance of these items to preschool age children based on their comprehensiveness and clarity. Based on their responses and feedback a modified pool of items was developed and administered to a convenience sample of 20 parents who rated these items according to their relevance. The test retest reliability was evaluated on another sample of 20 parents of 2-5 year old children. The final questionnaire comprised of 16 items (12 child and 4 family). This was administered to 300 parents of 24-71 months old children divided on the basis of early childhood caries to assess its reliability and validity.OH-ECQOL scores were significantly associated with parental ratings of their child's general and oral health, and the presence of dental disease in the child. Cronbach's alpha was 0.862, and the ICC for test-retest reliability was 0.94.The OH-ECQOL proved reliable and valid tool for assessing the impact of oral disorders on the quality of life of preschool children in Northern India.

VEvaluation of the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity of fixed dose combination: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in experimental animals.
p4107
aVIn India, a number of fixed dose drug combinations of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID's) are available, often as over-the-counter products. These combinations are being prescribed too. Evidence for efficacy of NSIAD fixed dose combination is lacking.The current study was undertaken to assess the analgesic and anti-inflammatory efficacy of these combinations over their individual components.The study used three NSAIDs viz; paracetamol, ibuprofen and diclofenac sodium, alone or in combination with paracetamol. Animals were divided into six groups with six animals in each group. Analgesic activity was tested by writhing test and paw edema model was used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity. The test drugs were administered orally 30 min prior to injecting 0.6% solution of glacial acetic acid intraperitoneally for writhing test. For paw edema test, after 30 min of drugs administration, animals were injected with 0.1 ml of 1% carrageenan in subplanter region for inducing inflammation. Paw volume was again measured at baseline and after 3 h of subplanter injection of 1% carrageenan.The analgesic and the anti-inflammatory activity of paracetamol and ibuprofen combination were significantly greater than the individual agents when used alone. However, no significant difference in the analgesic or anti-inflammatory activity was found between diclofenac sodium and its combination with paracetamol. It was observed that diclofenac sodium was the most efficacious of the analgesics tested. Combining paracetamol with diclofenac did not show superior analgesic activity compared to diclofenac alone (P = 0.18).Combining paracetamol with ibuprofen enhances analgesic/anti-inflammatory activity over their individual component but potentiation of analgesic activity of diclofenac was not seen when paracetamol was added to it.

aVTo observe prevalence of sleep disturbance (SD) in cerebral palsy (CP) children in a specific age-group and its correlation with SD in primary caregivers and other associated factors.This was a prospective cross-sectional study. SD assessed using Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) in CP children and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in caregivers. Fifty cases of clinically diagnosed CP [27 females, mean age: 107.9 \u0381 29.5 months (range: 78-180 months)] fulfilling criteria were included.Eighteen (36%) children had pathological sleep total score (TS) and Disorders of Initiating and Maintaining Sleep (DIMS) was the commonest SD (n = 25, 50%). All primary caregivers were mothers. Twenty-five (50%) mothers had SD on PSQI scale. DIMS, Disorders of Excessive Somnolence (DES), and TS had significant correlation with PSQI (P < 0.05). Disorders of Arousal (DA) and TS had significant correlation with seizures (P < 0.05) in CP children. Bed-sharing had significant correlation with SD in caregivers (P < 0.001) but not with CP children. No significant correlation was observed between SD in CP and gross motor function (Gross Motor Function Classification System), use of orthoses, and dental caries.Children with CP have underreported significant SD, which negatively impacts caregiver's sleep also. Seizure disorders and medications contribute significantly to SD.

aVWe studied the anatomical correlates of reflex hot water epilepsy (HWE) using multimodality investigations viz. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Five men (mean age: 27.0 \u0381 5.8 years) with HWE were subjected to MRI of brain, video-EEG studies, and SPECT scan. These were correlated with phenotypic presentations. Seizures could be precipitated in three patients with pouring of hot water over the head and semiology of seizures was suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. Ictal SPECT showed hyperperfusion in: left medial temporal - one, left lateral temporal - one, and right parietal - one. Interictal SPECT was normal in all five patients and did not help in localization. MRI and interictal EEG was normal in all the patients. The clinical and SPECT studies suggested temporal lobe as the seizure onset zone in some of the patients with HWE.

VMolecular analysis of PRRT2 gene in a case of paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia patient.
p4129
aVParoxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is an abnormal involuntary movement that is episodic or intermittent, with sudden onset, and the attacks are induced by sudden movement. Mutations in proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) gene have been implicated in the cause of this disorder. This study presents a case of PKD on the basis of clinical findings supported and evidences obtained through a mutational analysis. Sequencing of all the exons of PRRT2 gene revealed a frameshift mutation (p.R217Pfs*8) in exon 2 and a novel transition mutation (c.244C > T) in 5'-untranslated region (UTR). Though mutations in PRRT2 gene are well-established in PKD, this study for the first time presents a novel transition mutation in the exon 2 region.

aVIntravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is an accepted therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke presenting within 3-4.5 hours of symptom onset. Selection of the patient for thrombolysis depends on the careful assessment for the risk of post thrombolysis symptomatic haemorrhage (6.2-8.9%) which may be fatal. Atrial myxomas which are the commonest tumors of the heart are associated with stroke due to tumor/clot embolism. There are very few case reports of IVT and its outcome in patients with atrial myxoma with stroke. Some have reported successful thrombolysis, while others have reported intracerebral bleeding. In this report we describe our experience of IVT in atrial myxoma patient with ischemic stroke and review the relevant literature.

p4138
aVFungi are a relatively uncommon cause of brain abscess in neonates and early infancy. They are usually associated with predisposing factors like prematurity, low birth weight, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and prolonged stay in the intensive care unit. Candida tropicalis (C. tropicalis) is rapidly emerging as a nosocomial threat in the neonatal intensive care settings. This case report describes a neonate with C. tropicalis brain abscess who was diagnosed early and managed aggressively with a favorable outcome. Inadvertent use of intravenous antibiotics can have serious complications such as invasive fungal infection. Correct microbiological diagnosis is the key to successful treatment of deep-seated pyogenic infection. Fungal etiology should always be studied in relevant clinical settings.

Cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging,) showed right gangliocapsular acute infarct with supraclinoid cistern subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Cerebral digital substraction angiography (DSA) showed dilatation and narrowing of right distal internal carotid artery (ICA). Left ICA was chronically occluded. His inflammatory markers were significantly raised. Imaging features are suggestive of cerebral vasculitis. Arterial and venous infarcts due to thrombosis are known in CD. Our case presented with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage in supraclinoid cistern due to rupture of tiny aneurysm of perforator arteries causing SAH and infarction in right basal ganglia.

p4144
aVGastroesophageal reflux (GER) disease is a significant comorbidity of neuromuscular disorders. It may present as paroxysmal dyskinesia, an entity known as Sandifer syndrome. A 6-week-old neonate presented with very frequent paroxysms of generalized stiffening and opisthotonic posture since day 22 of life. These were initially diagnosed as seizures and he was started on multiple antiepileptics which did not show any response. After a normal video electroencephalogram (VEEG) was documented, possibility of dyskinesia was kept. However, when he did not respond to symptomatic therapy, Sandifer syndrome was thought of and GER scan was done, which revealed severe GER. After his symptoms got reduced to some extent, a detailed clinical examination revealed abnormal facies with flaccid quadriparesis. Muscle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of a specific congenital myopathy. On antireflux measures, those episodic paroxysms reduced to some extent. Partial response to therapy in GER should prompt search for an underlying secondary etiology.

VLangerhans cell histiocytosis of atlantoaxial joint in a middle-aged man presenting with deafness as first symptom and soft-tissue mass at neck showing excellent response to radiotherapy alone: Report of an extremely rare and unusual clinical condition and review of literature.
p4150
aVLangerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a disorder of clonal proliferation of dendritic cell mainly occurring in children. Spine involvement is rare. This usually presents with pain and torticollis when neck is involved. Histopathology with immunohistochemistry is confirmatory. Local curative therapy with excision or curettage is used for localized disease. Radiotherapy is usually reserved for selected cases. Systemic chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for widespread systemic disease. In this article, we present an unusual presentation of atlantoaxial LCH with mastoid involvement resulting in hearing loss as the first symptom and quadruparesis in a middle aged male patient, which was also associated with soft-tissue mass at the nape of the neck and deafness. The patient was treated with radical radiotherapy, which provided excellent response to the disease. Involvement of atlantoaxial joint and temporal bone associated with soft-tissue mass neck and deafness in a middle-aged man is an extremely rare clinical situation.

p4156
aVThis pilot study sought to determine whether the Malayalam adaptation of Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (M-ACE) can effectively identify patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI) and the impact of measures of learning and free recall.A cohort of 23 patients with a-MCI aged between 55-80 years diagnosed as per current criteria and 23 group matched cognitively normal healthy controls (CNHC) were studied. The measures of acquisition and delayed recall were the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS)-III (verbal and visual subsets) and Delayed Matching-to-sample Test (DMS)-48. Test scores of M-ACE registration and recall scores were included. To examine the differences in test performances between the groups, we compared the number of subjects with test scores less than 1.5 standard deviation (SD) of the control scores. Comparisons between a-MCI and controls were drawn using Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U tests.M-ACE registration component ascertained on a 24-point scale failed to demonstrate any differences between a-MCI and controls (P = 0.665) as opposed to recall judged on a cumulative 10-point scale (P = 0.001). Significant differences were noted in RAVLT list learning (P < 0.001) and list recall (P = 0.003), WMS-III paragraph learning (P <0.001) and recall (P = 0.007), visual learning (P = 0.004) and recall (P = 0.001).M-ACE recall scores are an effective screening tool to identify patients with suspected a-MCI. Both word list and paragraph learning and recall components have been found to be sensitive to concretely identify a-MCI and impairment on at least 2 tests should be considered in the diagnostic criteria of MCI rather than rely on a single screening battery.

aVParkinson's disease (PD) is associated with sleep disturbances, attributed to the neurodegenerative process and therapeutic drugs. Studies have found levodopa to increase wakefulness in some patients while increasing sleepiness in others.To confirm sleep disturbances in drug naïve PD patients and understand the impact of levodopa on their sleep.Twenty-three drug naïve PD patients and 31 age-gender matched controls were compared using the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). A polysomnogram objectively compared sleep quality. Of the 23 patients, the 12 initiated on levodopa were reassessed subjectively and through polysomnography after 2 months of therapy.Data was expressed as mean ± standard deviation, median, and range. Continuous variables were analyzed by Student's T test for normally distributed data and Mann-Whitney U test for skewed data. Discrete variables were compared by Chi Square tests (Pearson Chi square Test or Fisher's Exact Test). Wilcoxon signed ranks test was applied in the analysis of paired data pre- and post-levodopa. A P value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Statistical analysis of the data was done using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 12.Drug naïve PD patients had lower PDSS scores than controls. The sleep architecture changes observed on polysomnogram were reduced NREM Stage III and REM sleep and increased sleep latency and wake after sleep onset time. Following levodopa, improved sleep efficiency with reduced sleep latency and wake after sleep onset time was noted, coupled with improved PDSS scores. However, NREM Stage III and REM sleep duration did not increase.PD patients take longer to fall asleep and have difficulty in sleep maintenance. Sleep maintenance is affected by nocturia, REM behavioral disorder, nocturnal cramps, akinesia, and tremors, as observed in PDSS scores. Levodopa improves sleep efficiency by improving motor scores without altering sleep architecture.Poor sleep quality and sleep architecture changes occur secondary to the neurodegenerative process in PD patients. Though levodopa improves sleep quality by reducing rigidity and tremor, it does not reverse sleep architecture changes.

P value \u22640.05 was considered as significant. Crude odds ratios were computed to assess the strength of association between independent variables and dependent variables along with their 95% confidence intervals.We included 207 of cirrhosis of liver patients admitted in medicine department from November 2010 through November 2013. Nearly 83% patients were male and 63.2% patients were under the age of 45 years. Common features in these patients were ascites (71%) splenomegaly (63.3%) pedal edema (61.4%) icterus (46.4%) tingling (44.9%) gastrointestinal bleeding(39.1%), ataxia (26.6%), numbness(26.6%), distal motor weakness (21.7%) and paresthesia(20.8%). Among the manifestation of peripheral nerve involvement, loss of ankle reflex was the most common feature in 51.7%, followed by loss of temperature sense 29.5%, loss of vibration sense 20.8%, loss of touch 16.4%, loss of position sense 14.5% and loss of pain in 6.3% of the patients. Peripheral neuropathy was found in 53.6% [95% CI: 46.58- 60.56] study subjects on electrophysiological study.Analysis of electrophysiological study shows that the PN is very common in study subjects with cirrhosis of liver, especially in male subjects, during the middle age group.

aVThis study was carried out to assess different counteracting strategies used by patients with idiopathic Willis-Ekbom disease (RLS/WED). Whether these strategies were influenced by gender or disease severity was also assessed.A total of 173 patients of idiopathic RLS/WED were included in this study. Their demographic data was recorded. Details regarding the RLS/WED and strategies that they used to counteract the symptoms were asked. The severity of RLS/WED was measured with the help of the Hindi version of international restless legs syndrome severity rating scale. They were asked to provide the details regarding the relief obtained from all the strategies they used on three-point scale: no relief, some relief, and complete relief.Of the patients, 72% were females. Mean age of the subjects in this study was 39.6 ± 12.6 years, and male subjects were older than females. Four common strategies were reported by the patients to counter the sensations of RLS/WED: moving legs while in bed (85.5%), asking somebody to massage their legs or massaging legs themselves (76.9%), walking (53.2%), and tying a cloth/rope tightly on the legs (39.3%). Of all the patients who moved their legs, 6.7% did not experience any relief, 64.2% reported some relief, and 28.4% reported complete relief. Similarly, of all the patients who used "walking" to counteract symptoms, 50% reported complete relief, 44.5% reported some relief, and the rest did not experience any relief. Many of these patients reported that massage and tying a cloth/rope on legs brought greater relief than any of these strategies. Tying cloth on the leg was more common among females as compared to males (45.9% females vs. 23.5% males; \u03c7(2) = 7.54; P = 0.006), while patients with moderately severe to severe RLS/WED reported "moving legs in bed" (79.3% in mild to moderate RLS/WED; 91.8% in severe to very severe RLS; \u03c7(2) = 5.36; P = 0.02).Patients with RLS/WED use a variety of strategies to counteract symptoms. These strategies may be influenced by gender, disease severity, and cultural practices.

aVOxidative stress has been implicated in various disorders including epilepsy. We studied the antioxidant status in patients with epilepsy and aimed at determining whether there was any difference in the antioxidant levels between patients and controls, patients who are not on antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and on treatment, between individual AEDs and patients on monotherapy and polytherapy.Antioxidant levels like catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), vitamin E, glutathione (GSH), thiol group (SH), uric acid, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were compared between 100 patients with epilepsy and equal number of controls. Twenty-five patients who were not on AEDs were compared with patients on AEDs and the control group. Patients were divided into monotherapy and polytherapy group and antioxidant status was compared between the two groups and between individual drugs.Catalase, SH, vitamin E, and TAC were significantly low in patients with epilepsy than those in the control group (P < 0.001). GSH and uric acid did not show any difference; GPx in patients was significantly higher than those in the control group There were no differences in the antioxidant levels between the treated and the untreated groups; however, it was lower in untreated patients than controls (P < 0.001), suggesting that AEDs do not modify the oxidative stress. Patients on Valproate (VPA) showed higher catalase and GPx levels. Catalase was higher in the monotherapy than polytherapy group (P < 0.04).Our study found significantly low levels of antioxidant in patients as compared to controls. AED did not influence the antioxidant status suggesting that seizures induce oxidative stress.

VNeuropsychological deficits in temporal lobe epilepsy: A comprehensive review.
p4177
aVTemporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most prevalent form of complex partial seizures with temporal lobe origin of electrical abnormality. Studies have shown that recurrent seizures affect all aspects of cognitive functioning, including memory, language, praxis, executive functions, and social judgment, among several others. In this article, we will review these cognitive impairments along with their neuropathological correlates in a comprehensive manner. We will see that neuropsychological deficits are prevalent in TLE. Much of the effort has been laid on memory due to the notion that temporal lobe brain structures involved in TLE play a central role in consolidating information into memory. It seems that damage to the mesial structure of the temporal lobe, particularly the amygdale and hippocampus, has the main role in these memory difficulties and the neurobiological plausibility of the role of the temporal lobe in different aspects of memory. Here, we will cover the sub-domains of working memory and episodic memory deficits. This is we will further proceed to evaluate the evidences of executive function deficits in TLE and will see that set-shifting among other EFs is specifically affected in TLE as is social cognition. Finally, critical components of language related deficits are also found in the form of word-finding difficulties. To conclude, TLE affects several of cognitive function domains, but the etiopathogenesis of all these dysfunctions remain elusive. Further well-designed studies are needed for a better understanding of these disorders.

VInfluence of trial design, heterogeneity and regulatory environment on the results of clinical trials: An appraisal in the context of recent trials on acute stroke intervention.
p4183
aVThe outcome of randomized controlled trials can vary depending on the eligibility criteria of the patients entering into the trial, as well as the heterogeneity of the eligible population and/or the interventions. If the subject population and/or interventions are heterogeneous, the final outcome of the trial depends on the degree of concordance of effects of the subgroups of interventions on the subgroups of the subject population. The considerations that go into the calculation of sample size and determination of the study stopping rules also would affect the nature of the outcome of the study. In this paper we try to examine these phenomena with respect to the recent trials on endovascular therapy in acute ischemic stroke.

VEvolutionary genomics and population structure of Entamoeba histolytica.
p4189
aVAmoebiasis caused by the gastrointestinal parasite Entamoeba histolytica has diverse disease outcomes. Study of genome and evolution of this fascinating parasite will help us to understand the basis of its virulence and explain why, when and how it causes diseases. In this review, we have summarized current knowledge regarding evolutionary genomics of E. histolytica and discussed their association with parasite phenotypes and its differential pathogenic behavior. How genetic diversity reveals parasite population structure has also been discussed. Queries concerning their evolution and population structure which were required to be addressed have also been highlighted. This significantly large amount of genomic data will improve our knowledge about this pathogenic species of Entamoeba.

VPHA-4/FOXA-regulated microRNA feed forward loops during Caenorhabditis elegans dietary restriction.
p4192
aVDietary restriction (DR) increases life span and delays the onset of age-related diseases across species. However, the molecular mechanisms have remained relatively unexplored in terms of gene regulation. InC. elegans, a popular model for aging studies, the FOXA transcription factor PHA-4 is a robust genetic regulator of DR, although little is known about how it regulates gene expression. We profiled the transcriptome and miRNAome of an eat-2 mutant, a genetic surrogate of DR, by Next Generation sequencing and find that most of the miRNAs are upregulated in the young-adult worms, none significantly downregulated. Interestingly, PHA-4 can potentially regulate the expression of most of these miRNA genes. Remarkably, many of the PHA-4-regulated genes that are induced during DR are also targets of the PHA-4-upregulated miRNAs, forming a large feed-forward gene regulatory network. The genes targeted by the feed-forward loops (FFLs) are enriched for functions related to ubiquitin-mediated decay, lysosomal autophagy, cellular signalling, protein folding etc., processes that play critical roles in DR and longevity. Together our data provides a framework for understanding the complex and unique regulatory network employed during DR, suggesting that PHA-4 employs such FFLs to fine-tune gene expression and instil robustness in the system during energy crisis.

VHigh prevalence of type 2 diabetes melitus and its risk factors among the rural population of Pondicherry, South India.
p4195
aVWe aimed to assess the prevalence of type-2 diabetes in rural Pondicherry and to study the determinants of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) in the rural population of Pondicherry, south Induia.It was a cross-sectional community-based study conducted from November 2010 to January 2012 in two of the field practice villages affiliated to a Medical College in Pondicherry. Sample size was calculated using open source software, Open Epi Version 2.3.10. The sampling frame comprised individuals aged above 25 years and single stage cluster random sampling was carried out. After obtaining the verbal informed consent each of the study participants were interviewed face-to-face using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using the SPSS version 16.The age of the study participants ranged from 25 to 98 years with mean of 42.6 (±13.7) and majority of the study participants 339 (32.5%) from the age-group of 30-39 years. The prevalence of diabetes was 19.8% (60-69 years), 17.1% (40-49 years), 16.8% (50-59 years), and 13.6% (>69 years) among study subjects. In univariate analysis, higher age, being educated, unemployed and poor was associated with higher risk of diabetes mellitus (DM). Furthermore, a high triglyceride level was significantly associated with increase in the risk of DM (adjusted odds ratio: 3.01; 95% CI: 1.86, 4.86).Type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an important public health problem in the adults of rural Pondicherry. Among non-modifiable factors, higher age, better socio-educational background and positive family history of diabetes was significantly associated with T2DM.

VAntistreptokinase antibodies and outcome of fibrinolytic therapy with streptokinase for left-sided prosthetic valve thrombosis.
p4200
aVLeft-sided prosthetic valve thrombosis (PVT) is a serious complication of valve replacement. In developing countries, fibrinolysis with streptokinase (SK) is often used as the first line of treatment. Anti-streptokinase (anti-SK) antibodies are widely prevalent in the general population, but their effect on the efficacy and outcome of fibrinolysis with SK in patients with PVT is not known.Patients with rheumatic heart disease and prosthetic valve replacement presenting with a first episode of left-sided PVT were enrolled. All patients underwent fibrinolysis with SK. An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect anti-SK antibodies before fibrinolysis. Relationship of these antibodies to the outcome of fibrinolysis was evaluated.Forty-four patients treated for left-sided PVT were included. Thrombosis affected 33 mitral and 11 aortic prosthetic valves. On fibrinolysis with SK, 32 (73%) patients achieved complete success, whereas it was unsuccessful in the remaining 12 patients. There were 3 bleeding events, 1 stroke, and 3 deaths. Mean anti-SK antibody levels were not significantly different between patients who had complete success and those who did not (8.81 ± 2.43 vs 7.67 ± 1.26 Au/mL; P = .13) and did not correlate with the outcome after adjustment with other variables. Patients in New York Heart Association class III or IV had a greater chance of failed fibrinolytic therapy, even after adjustment for other prognostic variables (odds ratio 9.0; 95% CI 1.29-63.02; P = .027).Anti-SK antibody titers are not associated with success of fibrinolytic therapy using SK in patients with left-sided PVT.

VClinical events after transitioning from apixaban versus warfarin to warfarin at the end of the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial.
p4203
aVWe sought to assess the occurrence of events after blinded study drug discontinuation and transition to open-label vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in ARISTOTLE.At the end of ARISTOTLE, blinded study drug was stopped, and open-label VKA was recommended. For patients completing the trial on blinded study drug, a 2-day bridging period with apixaban or apixaban placebo was recommended (while beginning open-label VKA). Outcomes were assessed during the 30 days after stopping blinded study drug.Of the 6,809 patients in the apixaban group and 6,588 in the warfarin group who completed the trial on study drug, there were 21 strokes or systemic emboli (4.02%/year) and 26 major bleeding (4.97%/year) events in the apixaban group (transitioning to VKA) and 5 strokes or systemic emboli (0.99%/year) and 10 major bleeding (1.97%/year) events in the warfarin group (continuing on VKA), with most of the imbalance between groups being after the first week. Similar results were seen in the first 30 days of the trial where warfarin-naive patients starting warfarin had a higher rate of stroke or systemic emboli (5.41%/year) than warfarin-experienced patients (1.42%/year), a pattern not seen when starting apixaban. No similar increase in events with apixaban versus warfarin was seen during temporary or permanent study drug discontinuation during the trial.The excess in thrombotic and bleeding events in the apixaban group after study drug discontinuation appears to be related to an increased risk associated with the initiation of a VKA rather than a direct effect of apixaban. Whether \u22652 days of apixaban bridging improves outcomes during VKA transition is unknown and deserves further evaluation.

VHIP/PAP prevents excitotoxic neuronal death and promotes plasticity.
p4206
aVExcitotoxicity plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of perinatal brain injuries. Among the consequences of excessive activation of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate are oxidative stress caused by free radical release from damaged mitochondria, neuronal death and subsequent loss of connectivity. Drugs that could protect nervous tissue and support regeneration are attractive therapeutic options. The hepatocarcinoma intestine pancreas protein/pancreatitis-associated protein I (HIP/PAP) or Reg3\u03b1, which is approved for clinical testing for the protection and regeneration of the liver, is upregulated in the central nervous system following injury or disease. Here, we examined the neuroprotective/neuroregenerative potential of HIP/PAP following excitotoxic brain injury.We studied the expression of HIP/PAP and two of its putative effectors, cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 19 (ARPP19) and growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), in the neonatal brain, and the protective/regenerative properties of HIP/PAP in three paradigms of perinatal excitotoxicity: intracerebral injection of the NMDA agonist ibotenate in newborn pups, a pediatric model of traumatic brain injury, and cultured primary cortical neurons.HIP/PAP, ARPP19, and GAP-43 were expressed in the neonatal mouse brain. HIP/PAP prevented the formation of cortical and white matter lesions and reduced neuronal death and glial activation following excitotoxic insults in vivo. In vitro, HIP/PAP promoted neuronal survival, preserved neurite complexity and fasciculation, and protected cell contents from reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced damage.HIP/PAP has strong neuroprotective/neuroregenerative potential following excitotoxic injury to the developing brain, and could represent an interesting therapeutic strategy in perinatal brain injury.

VDispersion fraction enhances cellular growth of carbon nanotube and aluminum oxide reinforced ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene biocomposites.
p4209
aVUltrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is widely used as bone-replacement material for articulating surfaces due to its excellent wear resistance and low coefficient of friction. But, the wear debris, generated during abrasion between mating surfaces, leads to aseptic loosening of implants. Thus, various reinforcing agents are generally utilized, which may alter the surface and biological properties of UHMWPE. In the current work, the cellular response of compression molded UHMWPE upon reinforcement of bioactive multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and bioinert aluminum oxide (Al2O3) is investigated. The phase retention and stability were observed using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The reinforcement of MWCNTs and Al2O3 has shown to alter the wettability (from contact angle of ~88°±2° to ~118°±4°) and surface energy (from ~23.20 to ~17.75 mN/m) of composites with respect to UHMWPE, without eliciting any adverse effect on cytocompatibility for the L929 mouse fibroblast cell line. Interestingly, the cellular growth of the L929 mouse fibroblast cell line is observed to be dominated by the dispersion fraction of surface free energy (SFE). After 48 h of incubation period, a decrease in metabolic activity of MWCNT-Al2O3 reinforced composites is attributed to apatite formation that reduces the dispersion fraction of surface energy. The mineralized apatite during incubation was confirmed and quantified by energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction respectively. Thus, the dispersion fraction of surface free energy can be engineered to play an important role in achieving enhanced metabolic activity of the MWCNT-Al2O3 reinforced UHMWPE biopolymer composites.

VA non-adhesive hybrid scaffold from gelatin and gum Arabic as packed bed matrix for hepatocyte perfusion culture.
p4212
aVDevelopment of liver support systems has become one of the most investigated areas for the last 50 years because of the shortage of donor organs for orthotopic liver transplantations. Bioartificial liver (BAL) device is one of the alternatives for liver failure which provides a curing method and support patients to recover from certain liver failure diseases. The biological compartment of BAL is called the bioreactor where functionally active hepatocytes are maintained to support the liver specific functions. We have developed a packed bed bioreactor with a cytocompatible, polysaccharide-protein hybrid scaffold. The scaffold prepared from gelatin and gum Arabic acts as a packed bed matrix for hepatocyte culture. Quantitative evaluation of the hepatocytes cultured using packed bed bioreactor demonstrated that cells maintained liver specific functions like albumin and urea synthesis for seven days. These results indicated that the system can be scaled up to form the biological component of a bioartificial liver.
